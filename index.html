			 <p>Yesterday I visited a couple of galleries after a long time.</p>
<p>I got this gorgeous 12&quot; x 12&quot; print by <a href="https://www.alicechristinewalker.com">Alice Christine Walker</a> at <a href="https://www.blueskygallery.org">Blue Sky</a>.</p>

<p>I saw prints of the <a href="https://icantdescri.be/#/gravestones/">Gravestones project</a> by my friend Isaac at Blue Sky. I had seen these online but prints are always so much better.</p>

<p>I also went over to <a href="https://www.blackfish.com">Blackfish Gallery</a> where I saw <a href="https://idlehandsphoto.squarespace.com/new-events/fishbowl-ii-blackfish-gallery">these cyanotypes</a> by my friend Kim. She is the featured artist this month.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of cheesecakes but I took a chance on one this year. Although it was great, I&rsquo;ll continue to choose regular cakes for this tradition.</p>
<p>Mt. Adams cake remains my favorite. It is described thusly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fluffy hazelnut-coconut cake, praline Viennese buttercream, wild huckleberry compote, and huckleberry Italian buttercream.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cakes were sourced from <a href="https://www.papahaydn.com">Papa Haydn</a>, which is about as old as me.</p>

At the time it was the longest bike ride either of us had done. We have recalled that ride fondly over the years. Today, on a very pleasant and sunny Fall day, we did it again!</p>

<p>You can now write alt text for any image in Recent Uploads. Tap on an image. Write the text. Hit Save. This is attached to the export snippet at the time of export.</p>
<p>Notes about this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported for both export options, Markdown and HTML.</li>
<li>It can be filtered in the Recent Uploads with the filter button on the top right.</li>
<li>Not familiar with Alt Text? The editor includes a short summary with links to more information.</li>
<li>As part of this Recent Uploads has been redesigned to show every image in proper aspect ratio and with an indicator to show whether it has alt text attached.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to try it out before launch? <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">Join the beta!</a></p>
<p>This has been a big one 😅</p>

<ul>
<li>You can now change the size of images you upload to any size you like. You can also change the JPG compression quality. These features can be found in the redesigned Image preferences screen in Settings -&gt; Image.</li>
<li>Export preferences have a new option to wrap exported images in links to themselves. Find it in Settings -&gt; Export.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find these in <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">the new version that is out today</a>.</p>
<p>I hope you like and use these features as much as I do. Let me know what you think 😊</p>
<p>P.S. Note that this release does not contain the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/08/19/sneak-peek-at.html">support for Alt Text</a> that I talked about a few weeks ago. I&rsquo;m still working on that and should have that ready in the coming weeks.</p>

Here they are, pulled from the official source linked below, followed by some links to interesting articles that give lovely context.</p>

			 <p>Steamboat Rock is the main feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamboat_Rock_State_Park">Steamboat Rock State Park</a>, located by Banks Lake in central Washington. It has been an annual camping destination for Jenni&rsquo;s family for decades. This month was my first time there. We spent three nights at the campground there and had a wonderful time exploring the park and especially hiking up the rock.</p>
<p>The weather forecast had said that there may be thunderstorms with lightning the morning we were thinking of hiking up, but fortunately that warning moved to later in the day, so we got going a little before 10am.</p>
<p>There was a short trail that started right outside the campground and took us to the foot of the rock in a few minutes. This was a mostly flat, or a very gentle climb. There were five of us humans, and one very happy dog.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/b4ee634e37.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/b4ee634e37.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As we got closer the features of the rock became more discernible. The trail led us to the central part of the rock, to the start of the switchbacks that went up. Other trails lead there as well. Shortly before that was a picnic table, which seemed ideal for a pre/post hike snack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/9274cf0c96.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/9274cf0c96.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>These initial switchbacks are a mix of loose rocks and gravel, or just rock. It was the trickiest part of the hike and lasted maybe a quarter mile, with a moderate to steep slope.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/1145837d48.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/1145837d48.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/8a286fbd54.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/8a286fbd54.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Once we were above that part, the view expanded and we had two options on the trail. We could&rsquo;ve gone right followed by a right-loop, or we could&rsquo;ve gone left, and done a left-loop. That day we went right.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/35cf886b72.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/35cf886b72.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There was still more elevation to be gained for about a quarter mile before we reached the top of the rock. At this point we started the loop which went for a while along the edge. This afforded lovely views, starting with the campground area, followed by more expansive views of the lake, with rocky islands spotting it all over.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5032c4373a.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5032c4373a.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>After about twenty minutes of hiking and stopping to admire views, we came to the farthest point on the loop and the trail turned away from the edge. The return path was through grassy fields. To start, on our right there was a short slope to a lower elevation of a large field. In the distance we could see to the end of the rock plateau, then a gap and another large rock or hill beyond that.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>A short while of hiking on the plateau, with some gentle ups and down slopes, got us back to the start of the loop. Not much to see except a dramatic sky above and grassy fields on either side with a small variety of wildflowers.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/e7b050b515.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/e7b050b515.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We made our way back to the fork in the middle of the rock, descended the switchbacks, and soon found ourselves on the last stretch of the trail.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/cb174978d9.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/cb174978d9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At this point the sky was <em>very</em> dramatic. It seemed like the thunderstorm was about to start, and we were glad to not be the highest objects in the vicinity anymore.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a little solar powered helicopter on Mars. It&rsquo;s named Ingenuity and it has a little camera on its belly that looks downwards. This video has every image taken by that camera from the first one on April 3, 2021 (Sol 43) until today. Ingenuity is 19 inches (0.49m) tall and weighs 4 lbs (1.8kg).</p>

			<h1><a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/06/16/mimi-uploader-is.html">Mimi Uploader 2022.0 is out with new features for Recent Uploads 🎉</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/06/16/mimi-uploader-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2022-06-16 15:16:03 -0800">Jun 16, 2022</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images and are shown inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list. A badge is used to indicate one type or another. There are other minor UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. Mimi uploads shows a count of images. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so. The screenshots below show the new interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/39c018e6a5.png" alt="Screenshots showing interface changes described above."></a></p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set.</p>
<p>I hope you like this update as much as I liked making it.</p>

			 <p>After mulling over the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/05/06/sneak-peek-at.html">change to the Recent Uploads interface</a> over the last month, it seemed like the background color was a bit much, so I&rsquo;ve tweaked the design to show an icon on the right. I think this looks much better. An added benefit is that I can also add the icon to the filter menu on the top right so that the meaning becomes obvious.</p>

			 <p>Every morning I come into the living room and sit on the sofa and my brain says, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;m soon playing that game. This has been going on for months.</p>
<p>Last week I went camping for three nights and I didn&rsquo;t think of Wordle a single time. The morning after I returned I went into the living room and sat on the sofa and my brain said, &ldquo;Wordle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crazy how much of a pattern recognizer and responder the brain is, and how it makes these long lasting habits. Break a pattern briefly, lose a habit briefly.</p>

<p>Oh, and there was a time I used to get bothered by breaking a streak, but I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s behind me.</p>

			 <p>A query for computer keyboard people.</p>
<p>After a few days with an ErgoDox EZ I borrowed from a friend, I&rsquo;m realizing that I:</p>
<ul>
<li>like the split and the tenting.</li>
<li>also like the added flexibility of an additional layer or two.</li>
<li>currently don&rsquo;t want to change from the standard layout of keys that I&rsquo;m used to.</li>
<li>continue to like mechanical keys, and am open to non-clicky ones.</li>
<li>could give or take ortholinear layout.</li>
</ul>
<p>What keyboards are available that would fit these attributes? I&rsquo;m open to assembling if needed.</p>

			 <p>A little over a year ago Jenni and I made this wall mounted cookware hanging rack.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/29b5bd2792.jpg" alt="Boards mounted on a wall horizontally, with hardware mounted to the boards and pans and decorative items hanging off the hardware."></a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been wanting a place to put our pans for a while It&rsquo;s tedious to manage them in a drawer or cabinet, if you can even fit them in there. Often some would just stay on the stove and need to be moved out of the way when cooking. Whenever I would see pans hanging, in person or in a photo, it seemed like the best solution. We had space on only one wall in the kitchen, so that decision was easy.</p>
<p>Pans can be heavy and our walls are lathe and plaster, so mounting just about anywhere was out of the question. And so the construction method was narrowed down to boards mounted to studs, with hardware to hang the pans.</p>
<p>We went to the <a href="https://www.woodcrafters.us">amazing local woodworking store</a> where they have finished dimensional lumber and narrowed down our choice based primarily on cost. We wanted a dark color, and I already had dark walnut stain from the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/25/mail-and-keys.html">mail and keys organizer</a> I made a while back.</p>
<p>Back home, I cut the boards to length. We wanted a tight fit and the two ends, door frame and wall, weren&rsquo;t super plumb so there were a lot of measurements and dry fitting before we had a set of boards that were just right. It was time to apply the stain and let it rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/5efd3a72bb.jpg" alt="A triptych of ca can of dark walnut stain, lumber stacked in a store showing a price of $4.29 per linear foot, and Jenni applying the stain to the boards while wearing a respirator."></a></p>
<p>After that it was a straightforward process of screwing in the boards to the studs while using a couple of small blocks to space them evenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/04343ec9ad.jpg" alt="A triptych showing progression of boards being arranged and mounted on to the wall, and with hardware attached."></a></p>
<p>Once that was done, we installed a couple of IKEA rails that we had and the rack was ready to use. In the days that followed we sourced some nice hooks and Jenni put up a couple of planters and some homegrown produce.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/84b2a87972.jpg" alt="A diptych showing details of various things hanging off the rack, a planter, dry red chillis, a bunch of garlic pigtailed together and a small plant watering can."></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been over a year and this has totally been worth it. I highly recommend utilizing vertical space in the kitchen where you can.</p>
<p>P.S. This blog post should&rsquo;ve been written about a year ago. Anyway, it&rsquo;s been written now.</p>

<p>As I was taking these photos I was thinking how I prefer the 2x for compositions when it comes to zoom. 3x is handy but I have so many years of composing in ~50mm (2x on iPhone). Alas, iPhone 13 Pro can only do 2x with a crop on 1x image. Here I thought the tradeoff was worth it.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://samgrover.com/2022/05/06/sneak-peek-at.html">Sneak peek at a new feature coming soon to Mimi Uploader</a></h1>

			 <p>Recent Uploads currently shows the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. After the next update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else 🎉</p>
<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>
<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images. So the UI challenge before me was how to show these other types of recent uploads. At first I started to make a new screen that listed all the uploads on an account but that wasn&rsquo;t working, primary reason being that it was boring af. After mulling it over I came up with an interface that feels better as a part of Mimi, and that&rsquo;s illustrated in the video below:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>All uploads on the account show up inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list that is in the current version. There are subtle UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. the background color for each kind of post is different. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe. Sets of uploads made from Mimi can still be deleted with a left swipe. As always this only deletes the batch from Mimi and doesn&rsquo;t affect the uploaded images. Other uploads don&rsquo;t offer the deletion because they are representing the images on Micro.blog and not an uploaded set. This <em>may</em> cause confusion but I currently don&rsquo;t have a design to avoid that. Got ideas?</p>
<p>I should have a beta out by this weekend so you can try this feature out if you like. To get on the beta, <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/AbjtGWge">sign up for it with TestFlight</a>.</p>

			 <p>Over the last week I framed and installed a window in the shed in our yard.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As part of this project, I also started using a &ldquo;real&rdquo; video editor. I&rsquo;ve edited videos in the past using iMovie, but this was quite different, as expected, and it was fun to pick up a lot of the beginner level skills in the process.</p>
<p>The editor I used was DaVinci Resolve, mostly because it has a version available for free and it is a very capable app for video editing on the Mac.</p>
<p>I watched a YouTube video to learn how to get going and to get familiar with the interface. Then I would search when I wanted to figure out how to do something specific as I went along e.g. extracting a frame to use as a thumbnail.</p>
<p><strong>Update: 18th May, 2022.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I finally got around to putting a frame on the window.</p>
<p>The other window on the shed has angled ends on the top piece, so I measured and mirrored them on the top piece of this one. I cut it on the table saw as shown in the photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/6a900f49b6.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2022/6a900f49b6.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a photo of the window with the frame.</p>

			 <p>Before our return to Portland from Tucson, I was really looking forward to flying over Arizona and Utah because there are so many landscapes there that I adore and have seen from the ground as well.</p>
<p>And the views did not disappoint! Here are a few along with my best guess for the place.</p>

			 <p>I went on a photowalk with my friend Andrew today and got to try a really old Leica lens that he found in a thrift store recently. It was a <a href="https://www.kenrockwell.com/leica/135mm-f45.htm">Leitz Hektor 135mm f/4.5</a> and was probably made in the 1950s.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/4dd9da9f1e.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/4dd9da9f1e.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s remarkable how I can just attach this nearly 70 year old lens to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leica_M10">Leica M10</a>, a modern digital camera made just a few years ago. I&rsquo;ve read how Leica M maintains compatibility with the oldest products but today I got to try out. It just works!</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/613f2c27de.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/613f2c27de.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Focusing was a bit tricky to start but I got the hang of it after a few photos.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b3b4b835b9.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b3b4b835b9.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Then I had to start &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; with this long focal length. That took a minute. I&rsquo;m used to a 35mm or 50mm lens and this is <em>very</em> different.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b22919a1c0.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/b22919a1c0.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Got some okay photos. I had no expectation to start composing anything worthwhile with this in an hour.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/228851792d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/228851792d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t go wrong with a store window selfie though 😄</p>

<p>a) I like it for reasons I describe in this <a href="https://twitter.com/samgrover/status/1425129915947438086">twitter thread</a>.</p>
<p>b) I know some of the people behind it. They are good people and I trust their intention as described on their website.</p>

			 <p>💰 Financial (Pro?) Tip for US based folks: You can get a free credit report from the main bureaus via <a href="https://www.annualcreditreport.com/">annualcreditreport.com</a>. Once per year per bureau. I’ve been getting them regularly for years to review what creditors have on file. However I get a report from each of the three bureaus every four months. That way I have a little insight into my credit every four months and I can spread them out to once per year per bureau so they are always free. The site can feel a little clunky but it is a good resource IMHO.</p>

<p><strong>Update (9th August, 2021):</strong> I took it in to the Apple store today after making an appointment at the Genius Bar. They took it in for an hour and repaired it. Not sure if they replaced the entire 1x camera module but the issue is gone 🎉</p>

			 <p>While at the coast last weekend, we went on an excursion to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neskowin_Ghost_Forest">Neskowin Ghost Forest</a>.</p>
<p>That day it was a foggy with columns of rising steam visible. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is common there but it sure added to the spookiness of the name.</p>
<p>As in many parts of the Oregon coast there were rock formations of various sizes that dot the landscape and make it ever more interesting than just a sandy beach.</p>

<p>The new version features a new layout system for the main screen to better view your picked images. This layout scales to maximize your content for all screen sizes and orientations. As you can see in the comparison above, the same six photos are viewed with better detail in the new layout.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/be2b12849f.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/be2b12849f.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This version also features a new button on the main screen in the toolbar at the bottom. Toggling this fits or fills each image in the space available to it. The comparison above shows each state for six chosen photos of varying aspect ratios.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/c79662d301.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/c79662d301.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Also in this update is a new Tip Jar in the Settings screen. Mimi Uploader has always been offered at a one-time fixed price. The addition of new features and all upkeep is complimentary, so any tips to support that effort are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support! 😊</p>

<p>A new TestFlight beta of Mimi Uploader is out for testing with this Tip Jar. If things look good, I should be able to release a new version in a few days with the new layout and image display options, in addition to this.</p>

<p>This is my first Sailor pen. I got it as a present and have been pleasantly surprised at how nice it is to use and hold. I really wasn&rsquo;t expecting this level of quality in this price range. I use it daily with my work notebook. 🖋</p>

			 <p>I built a wall-mounted rack for a bathroom and am quite happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/8b8ad3aee8.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/8b8ad3aee8.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The bathroom on the main level in our house is used occasionally by us. It is also the one that is used by visitors. It has never had a good place to put stuff. The sink doesn&rsquo;t have enough room on it for anything besides the soap, and there is no vanity cabinet in which to put things. We decided a long time ago that there needed to be something.</p>
<p>It is a small room, so the only real option was a wall, and this was pretty much the only place to mount something like this on the wall in a manner that it wasn&rsquo;t in the way, or in an awkward spot.</p>
<p>At some point I came across <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h69ZB-P8W8w">this video</a> and realized that this design could work well. The main constraint as shown in the video was depth. This was also the case in our bathroom so as to not interfere with the shower door next to it. A secondary constraint was the light switches but that was straightforward to design around. Also, unlike that video, I couldn&rsquo;t drill the sides into a wall because there is just trim board on one side and stone tiles on the other. So I made some adjustments to adapt that design to our needs.</p>
<p>And so many months ago I got the materials. Then something or the other delayed the project but a couple months ago I finally started on it. And in small increments I built it up. A few weeks ago and after some mistakes and corrections, I finally applied paint and finish, and mounted it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks in perspective with a wide angle lens.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/7fa7f36ee2.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/7fa7f36ee2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>P.S. The video I linked is from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIrtu3uSwehD0pfmfMsHhUA">Darbin Orvar</a> channel, of which I&rsquo;m a fan, and have followed for many years. Highly recommended!</p>

			 <p>A new beta of Mimi Uploader will be coming your way shortly. This includes layout updates for the main screen for all screen sizes and orientations.</p>
<p>It also includes a new button to toggle viewing images in their entirety. Here&rsquo;s an example.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/2e3a58cc07.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>On the left is the way images will show by default, but tapping the new button in the bottom toolbar scales the images so they fit in their available space, as shown on the right.</p>
<p>Try it out and let me know what you think 😊</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m trying out a new image layout algorithm for the main screen on Mimi Uploader. The idea is to utilize more of the screen real estate and to adjust the size of each photo based on the total number.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a before/after in the portrait orientation.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/92b6a70727.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/92b6a70727.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite encouraged by this and already finding it useful in development.</p>

			 <p>A new version of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a> is now out with my favorite new feature in a while. <strong>You can now access your Recent Uploads for reference or export!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/5627108d83.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Recent Uploads can be accessed by the icon on the top left of the main screen. Once in there, you can see a list of your ten most recent uploads sessions. Each of those can be independently exported to get the URLs in Markdown or HTML. Now if you miss exporting right after an upload, or somehow lose the exported text, you can still get to it later. I hope you enjoy this feature and find it useful like I do.</p>
<p>This release has been a long time coming. Working on this app is another one of those things that&rsquo;s slowed down in the pandemic. I&rsquo;m hoping to give it more attention in the future and have a list of features and improvements that I would like to bring to you.</p>
<p>If you find Mimi useful, please let others know, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">leave a rating and/or review</a>. It is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>For those of us who use an Apple Watch, you can now unlock your Face ID equipped phone when wearing a mask. This works very well. You can find it in Settings -&gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode and scrolling down. &ldquo;Mercury&rdquo; in the screenshot is the name I&rsquo;ve given my watch.</p>

<p>Now you can opt out of any systematic tracking by apps. If you leave that switch on, some apps will ask you for permission and you can allow or deny on a case by case basis. It was off and I&rsquo;ve left it as is. You can find it in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Tracking.</p>

			 <p>Last week NASA landed the Perseverance rover on Mars. I watched live the entry, descent, and landing phase as events happened. It was quite exciting.</p>
<p>Today they released a set of high definition videos from various cameras that captured the descent and landing in amazing detail. This is a first and wow, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4czjS9h4Fpg">that footage is incredible</a>!</p>
<p>NASA also released the first ever audio recorded on another planet. Today I heard the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nasa/first-sounds-from-mars-filters-out-rover-self-noise">breeze on Mars</a>. Amazing!</p>
<p>Perseverance carries with it the Ingenuity helicopter. So we will have the first powered flight on Mars to look forward to in the near future. And I&rsquo;ll be sure to tune in for that.</p>
<p>All the media will be available in the public domain via the <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/">Perseverance site</a>.</p>

			 <p>About a week ago we were at the beginning of a &ldquo;historic&rdquo; winter storm. It had waves of various kinds of precipitation. Snow, sleet, ice, freezing rain, rain.</p>
<p>At the end of it there was the thickest layers of ice on everything that I&rsquo;d ever seen in these parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/de1b0dab31.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We lost power on Sunday night at 7pm. Thankfully, it was restored on Monday at 1:30pm. At one point we emptied the fridge of perishables and placed them in a cooler outside. At least there was plenty of ice around to keep things cold 😄. I&rsquo;m grateful that this was a minor inconvenience to us compared to what many others are going through with recent weather.</p>
<p>All in all over 500,000 people were without power around here due to various causes, like downed power lines, equipment failures, substation failures. Crews have been working 24/7 to restore utilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/503f168836.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/503f168836.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It all began to thaw that Monday afternoon as the temperatures rose and the Sun came out for a while.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/3cb05aa33c.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2021/3cb05aa33c.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Now several days later, there&rsquo;s still plenty of downed tree branches, and snow on the ground thawing slowly. Temperatures have remained above freezing but sunshine is still rare.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I finished reading The Broken Earth Trilogy by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._K._Jemisin">N.K. Jemisin</a>.</p>
<p>I read the first book last year. I was sufficiently intrigued that I bought the second book soon after, but for whatever reason I didn&rsquo;t start reading it until a couple of months ago. Fortunately it starts in a way that helped recall the story within the first few chapters. It then built upon the world and the characters as any good middle book. Once I&rsquo;d finished that, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to read the third one. I bought it right away and read it voraciously over the last two weeks. It did a great job of tying it all together and was very satisfying.</p>
<p>These books have been my introduction to the work of N.K. Jemisin and I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading more of her work in the future.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Last year <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/05/26/we-made-a.html">we built a gardening bed</a> in the spring and used it for summer vegetables and for garlic over the winter. A bed in that region of our yard did a lot better than our existing beds, especially for tomatoes, so we decided that we would build a new one next to it in 2020.</p>
<p>Well, last weekend we built that new gardening bed. It&rsquo;s the end of the main vegetable growing season but it is also the time to plant garlic. The ones from last year came out great. Apparently you should rotate the bed you use for garlic, so that became the impetus to get the new one set up.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d bought some 4x4 lumber almost two months ago for this. Some weeks ago I&rsquo;d cut ten pieces down to half with my Japanese pull saw. I love that saw. It makes cutting thick lumber pretty much effortless.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/b084ec0270.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/b084ec0270.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We went to <a href="https://portlandnursery.com">our local gardening store</a> and bought 14 bags of 3 cubic feet of raised bed potting mix. Borrowing a truck from my friend made that easy. Oh and it was fun to drive a stick shift after a long time.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c2e80d2f4.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c2e80d2f4.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>We cleared the space next to the previous bed, leveled it, laid down the fabric and finalized the location.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/37a9247071.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/37a9247071.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Then came the part of assembling the structure. I had used 6&quot; construction lag screws, with a 5/16&quot; shaft last time. So I went and bought more. The ones I bought this time were a bit different and proved to be a little harder to use. After some trial and error, the final process involved pre-drilling with a long 3/16&quot; bit and screwing in the lag screw after that. Here&rsquo;s a comparison of the two screws. The one on the left is the new one.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Having resolved that we built up all the layers for the structure.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The final step was loading all the dirt which went by a lot faster with bags than it did with shoveling a pile last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Some slo-mo fun was had too!</p>

<p>A couple of days later Jenni planted all the garlic. So we&rsquo;re good to go and expecting a bunch in June 2021!</p>

			 <p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now. Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>
<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>
<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It&rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.</p>
<p>In these pandemic days it&rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I&rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I&rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I&rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives. Once that is the case I may even enable notifications for all motion events, if needed. There have been one or two cases when the delivery person delivered something on the porch and didn&rsquo;t trigger the motion sensing. Hopefully those will get ironed out. I can still see those because I&rsquo;ve set things up to record all video on a buffer that lasts several days. The interface for recorded video is great and makes it really easy to look at relevant events which get logged.</p>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it. It was an interesting project where I tackled and solved problems that were new-to-me and that&rsquo;s always the best part.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was one of those amazing Fall days when the sky is clear and the air is crisp. After going through ten days dealing with wildfire smoke, and another few days of overcast skies and much-needed rain, it was a welcome change. So, we went out for a short hike in <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Tolinda-Ridge_Trail_Loop_Hike">the Forest Park area</a>.</p>
<p>There are nice views from the trail. This is at a viewpoint very close to the start. St John&rsquo;s Bridge, with Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Rainier in the distance.</p>

<p>Mt. Hood, as seen from St John&rsquo;s Bridge. We couldn&rsquo;t get parking at the trailhead so we parked at the other end of the bridge and walked over it. That was an additional bit of fun despite my not-so-great feelings of looking down from it 😅.</p>

<p>After the hike we ended up at this recently opened food cart pod and had a meal there. This was the first time we&rsquo;ve eaten out since the pandemic started. It was a bit unnerving for me to be in the midst of so many people without masks but overall it was enjoyable.</p>

			 <p>The new version requires iOS 14 and utilizes its new system photo picker. This enables you to easily browse and search your entire library to add photos to upload. You are no longer restricted to the recent few thousand photos.</p>
<p>As a result of this change Mimi no longer requires or asks for Photos permission. Yay for privacy! You will never be prompted for that again. Only the photos you explicitly add will now be accessible to Mimi and shown in the grid.</p>
<p>This update also adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for PNG files to preserve their format.</li>
<li>Larger photo preview in the grid.</li>
<li>Contextual menus on photos in the grid and on some action buttons. Press and hold to discover these.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you will like this update and please do let me know any feedback you may have. I&rsquo;m now working on adding new features to the app and hope to write about that soon. Thank you for your continued support! 😊</p>

			 <p>For various reasons, I&rsquo;ve not been able to give Mimi the time and attention I&rsquo;d hoped over the last several months, but I&rsquo;m actively trying to change that. I&rsquo;m working on an update that takes a fresh approach to the photo selection flow by utilizing new features coming in iOS 14.</p>
<p>iOS 14 has a powerful new system provided photo picker that lets users pick photos from their library. The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I&rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.</p>
<p>I had planned to enhance the original photo selection screen with new features for better selection, but now I can utilize that time towards other features that folks have requested. Features that I think will be a lot more useful in the long term, like support for the share sheet, and drag and drop, that allows sending photos into Mimi from other apps. And I have more ideas that I hope to share after this initial set of work is complete.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to bring this new experience to you sometime after iOS 14 launches this Fall. I appreciate your support and comments. If you&rsquo;ve liked using Mimi, I&rsquo;d love it if you could <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">give it a rating or review on the App Store</a>. Thank you!</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood, i.e. the pandemic life.</li>
<li>There was one day where I took a photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning. So there goes my 30 day photo blogging pin on Micro.blog. Again 🤦‍♂️</li>
<li>Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😬.</li>
<li>This photo challenge was managed by <a href="https://micro.welltempered.net/2020/07/23/august-photoblogging-challenge.html">@macgenie</a>.</li>
<li>The last one I did was the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2020/03/02/all-my-february.html">February photoblogging challenge</a>.</li>

			 <p>We wanted to adopt a kitten from the <a href="https://www.oregonhumane.org">Oregon Humane Society</a>. In these days of the pandemic, their adoption process has changed and you&rsquo;re only allowed to apply online. So we checked their website regularly. That&rsquo;s when we noticed that demand is very high these days so the window to apply was very short. New kittens would get posted but by the time we noticed and applied, they would already have been spoken for. This went on for a week or so.</p>
<p>So I did what any programmer might do, I implemented a script to detect when new kittens are posted. It was run every five minutes for about three weeks. Now it has been retired with the arrival of Mr. Momo a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/3a6b30c57d.jpg"><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/3a6b30c57d.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The script flow is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the page that lists kittens.</li>
<li>Use some regular expressions to get the relevant data out.</li>
<li>Open a local JSON file of saved kittens from the previous run so that the new kittens can be identified.</li>
<li>If there are new kittens, use <a href="https://www.pushcut.io">Pushcut</a> to send a notification to my phone (and watch).</li>
<li>If the notification is successful, save the list of currently available kittens in a local JSON file for referencing in the next run.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was loaded as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd"><code>launchd</code></a> service on my always-on Mac, which I manage using <a href="https://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/">LaunchControl.app</a>.</p>

			 <p>I have now been subscribed to <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a while. I wrote <a href="http://samgrover.com/2019/04/14/initial-experience-with.html">a post about my initial experience</a> in April 2019. Recently I figured it was a good time to re-evaluate how it&rsquo;s working out. So here are some similar lists as last time. Apps are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Apps I&rsquo;m currently using on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li>MarsEdit</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>Unite</li>
<li>iStatMenus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I use occasionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downie</li>
<li>Dropshare</li>
<li>Expressions</li>
<li>Folx</li>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>MindNode</li>
<li>Permute</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that I&rsquo;ve used just once or twice or briefly for a project. These were handy when I needed them and now I know they&rsquo;re there and can use them again if a similar need arises.</p>
<ul>
<li>Archiver</li>
<li>CleanMyMacX</li>
<li>GlueMotion</li>
<li>Jump Desktop</li>
<li>TablePlus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that I thought I&rsquo;d use more often but haven&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ulysses</li>
</ul>
<p>On the whole I think Setapp is still providing me value for the subscription and I look forward to the new apps they add. If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">use my referral code</a>.</p>

<p>Ashish Grover, or Ashu, as we called him endearingly passed away on Monday, 6th July, 2020 in New York City. His passing was sudden and unexpected. It has shaken up our entire family across two vast countries. He was only 48. Now he will forever be 48.</p>
<p>Technically he was my cousin, but we grew up under the same roof in New Delhi, our mothers cooked side by side in the same kitchen, we ate at the same table. I shared his room for a while in the 80s, as our growing joint family was on the verge of becoming a nuclear one. He was my brother.</p>
<p>He was funny, full of life, and shared the joy of it at all occasions. He achieved tremendous success in his career, and would&rsquo;ve reached higher had he had the time. As we grew older, we grew apart, but only in distance, as we pursued our lives and dreams. I would only see him every few years. Those times were always wonderful. So it was a joy when he moved to the US in 2017 as I managed to see him more often then. I am grateful for that.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/6c5ef710bb.jpg" alt="With Ashish and Manisha. New York City. September, 2018."></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/0f7814aeb2.jpg" alt="Us. Columbia River Gorge. July, 2019."></p>
<p>His passing was not as a result of COVID-19, but that has certainly impacted all related events since then, including my inability to attend his funeral in person. I couldn&rsquo;t manage it. Others in our family managed it and showed up to support his grieving wife and daughter.</p>
<p>I attended his funeral service via a video call. There were about 25 people present in person, masked and social distanced as best as could be managed. A few hundred people were on the call. If that number feels large, know that far more would have shown up in person if this vile event had happened in better times, and at the place he had called home for twenty years. Over the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve heard several stories of his friendships, generosities and kindnesses. He was beloved by many.</p>
<p>Our family has set up <a href="https://ashish-grover.forevermissed.com">an online memorial site</a>. If you knew him, I encourage you to share something there if you like.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/f81c09196a.jpg" alt="Us, with our sisters. Circa 1980s."></p>
<p>As someone said, he lives amongst the stars now. Rest in peace bhai ❤️</p>

We try and go each year around this time when the roses are in full bloom. It never disappoints, even with an overcast sky. Of course it was a little different this year, as with everything else.</p>

			 <p>A couple of days ago I finished reading <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780441478125?aff=samgrover">The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. It was published fifty-one years ago, but feels like it could&rsquo;ve been this year. A wonderful and timeless story written with immaculate detail, and emotional depth. There were many sentences all over the book that I read more than once because they were worth savoring.</p>
<p>I first heard of Ursula K. Le Guin a long time ago. At the time I thought of her as a Fantasy author, and I used to think of myself as someone that enjoys reading Sci-Fi, but not Fantasy. It was an arbitrary distinction that I hope is behind me. But as a result I didn&rsquo;t introduce myself to her work even though she was frequently mentioned in the context of Sci-Fi. I hope to read more of her works in the future.</p>

			 <p>Just saw two great examples of tech activism.</p>
<p>First was an Instagram story where all you had to do was swipe up and that opened a webpage which then brought up an email composer filled out with an email and with email addresses populated. You just had to update placeholders with your info and hit send.</p>
<p>Second is this bot that requests people to update their black square photos on Instagram so that they don&rsquo;t drown out actual black voices using the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag: <a href="https://github.com/char/blm-instagram-bot">github.com/char/blm-&hellip;</a></p>
<p>Both are brilliant. My hats off to these folks.</p>

			 <p>About three months ago I heard of someone using a trackpad with their non-dominant hand at their Mac. Now I&rsquo;d heard of such a use before but this time I had a trackpad lying around. I&rsquo;d gotten it with my Mac instead of a mouse because I already had a mouse, but had stashed it away. So I got it out and set it up for my left hand.</p>
<p>A month passed. I was using it rarely. One day the battery in my mouse ran out in the middle of the workday, so I plugged it in and moved the trackpad over to the right side.</p>
<p>A day passed, and the mouse had long been charged, so I unplugged it, but for whatever reason I kept using the trackpad.</p>
<p>A week passed and I realized that I was liking the trackpad a lot more than the mouse. So I put the mouse in the closet.</p>
<p>Now two months have passed and I can&rsquo;t think of going back. The gestures are intuitive and I&rsquo;ve found several operations to be a lot smoother.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a happy <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MRMF2LL/A/">Magic Trackpad 2</a> user 😊.</p>

			 <p>A day off from work was a good idea. We went for a hike at Coyote Wall.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/e93f4f1ba1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The trails have a gentle grade and there’s plenty of room to distance ourselves when we come across other people.</p>

<p>Lovely views. Small streams and falls. Birds and flowers.</p>

<p>We’d gone there <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html">last April</a> as well. This time around we just did a four mile loop.</p>

			 <p>Inspired by Patrick Rhone&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.patrickrhone.net/reading/">/reading</a> page, I&rsquo;ve created a <a href="https://samgrover.com/books/">Books page</a> on my site.</p>
<p>Following is the process I followed to make that happen on my Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li>Export all my books out of Goodreads. You can find the page to do that by navigating to &ldquo;My Books&rdquo; and selecting &ldquo;Import and export&rdquo; at the bottom of the left sidebar under &ldquo;Tools&rdquo;. The exported file is of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV format</a>, which is pretty standard.</li>
<li>Open the export file in a spreadsheeting app. I use <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id409203825?mt=12">Numbers.app</a>. Here, you can clean up any data. I added some ISBNs that were missing. I also saved this file so I can just update it in the future as I read books. Another reason I went through this step was because I was having a hard time parsing the original CSV file using the script I wrote.</li>
<li>Export the spreadsheet file as CSV.</li>
<li>Run it through the script below to generate Markdown that can be pasted directly into the page on my site.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the script:</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I constrained myself to photos taken on that day. No digging into the archives.</li>
<li>A lot of these were taken around the house or the neighborhood. I work from home and tend to go on walks at various times during the day.</li>
<li>Some days I took the photo but forgot to post and posted the next morning.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t usually do photo challenges, daily or otherwise, so this was harder than I expected. Some days I kinda winged it, as can be seen 😜.</li>

			 <p>Hello friends!</p>
<p>I’m very excited to announce the launch and availability of my new app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696">Mimi Uploader</a>.</p>
<p>Mimi is designed from the ground up to enable super fast uploading of photos from your device to your Micro.blog hosted blogs. Utilize Mimi to upload a set of photos for making your blog post. Maybe a road trip, or a party, or memories of a special day.</p>
<p>Here’s a video of Mimi in action:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I found myself uploading batches of photos to Micro.blog fairly frequently, usually to have them all in a blog post about an activity, or event, or a photo essay. I designed and developed Mimi to make that flow as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>It works just as well for single photo posts. I’ve been using it all month for the February photo blogging challenge.</p>
<p>I hope you find it as useful as I do 😊</p>

			 <p>As of the last several years, I’ve spent a lot less time gaming than before. I&rsquo;m basically an occasional gamer. It is with that in mind that I recently sold my PS4 which was lying unused, and bought a subscription to Apple Arcade that let&rsquo;s me play games on several devices and for short windows of time.</p>
<p>I’ve played a few games on it now, and by far my favorite has been “<a href="https://www.whatthegolf.com">WHAT THE GOLF?</a>”. I don’t think I’ve had as much fun playing a game in a while. I fire it up a few times a week on my iPhone and make a little progress each time. It is interesting, inventive, clever, and above all, hilarious. I’m 77% through the game and savoring the last of it. I hope this team makes more games and I look forward to them.</p>

			 <p>Things you are not speaking that your kitchen smart assistant is adding to your profile on the company server, now or in the near future:</p>

<li>Noting which notifications are you most likely to respond to by picking up and unlocking your phone.</li>
<li>That deep breath you just took after a particular notification rang on a particular device.</li>
<li>That bag of chips you opened a short while after you took that deep breath.</li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, correlating this data to the time, date, current weather conditions, and past behavior.</p>
<p>Perhaps the company that makes the assistant also knows the content of those notifications and everything else happening on that device because they make that as well.</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago we went on a bike ride on the <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Banks-Vernonia_Traverse_Hike">Banks Vernonia State Trail</a> on the outskirts of the Portland metro area. It was a lovely Fall day. We started at Banks Trailhead, rode for a while past the Buxton Trestle bridge, and then returned the same way. A lot of the way was flat and some parts had a gentle slope. We had a great time. Following are some photos from then.</p>

			 <p>Part of my gym routine involves using a treadmill. And each time after I complete that, I take a photo of the readout.</p>
<p>This morning I took one with my new iPhone 11 Pro and got the following photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d9b9918c82.jpg" alt="Clipped"></p>
<p>As you can see, parts of the readout were invisible or clipped. I think it is because the speed of the default camera app in those conditions is just too fast in comparison to the refresh rates on that LED readout. The cameras can go really fast with shutter speeds, but there’s a lot of computational photography involved, so the final composite shutter speed may vary.</p>
<p>Luckily I noticed this right away, and decided to use the new “night mode” feature which allows you to effectively slow down the shutter speed while maintaining stability. And that got me the following photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/baabe6aeb7.jpg" alt="Proper, with longer exposure."></p>
<p>Phew! This is readable.</p>
<p>P.S. For details on the new camera capabilities, check out <a href="https://blog.halide.cam/iphone-11-pro-preview-the-camera-hardware-changes-16a543b77c24" title="iPhone 11 Pro Preview: The Camera Hardware Changes">this great article by Halide</a>.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been using a <a href="https://www.owcdigital.com/products/thunderbay-4">OWC Thunderbay 4 (Thunderbolt 2)</a> external enclosure with four 3 TB hard disk drives for the last two years. I bought it on eBay as a new but opened product. It’s been great. I had two of the drives in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_0">RAID 0</a> configuration (for higher bandwidth single volume) and they were serving as the primary storage of about 1 TB of photos.</p>
<p>Recently I decided to partially upgrade that setup by purchasing a Crucial 2 TB SSD. In order to install it I also had to purchase a <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/MEQX3TRAY/">OWC Spare Drive Tray</a> since the ones in my Thunderbay didn’t have the right setup for 2.5” drives. That took a few days to arrive. In the meantime I installed the SSD into an old USB LaCie enclosure and moved my files over to it.</p>
<p>I decided to measure the drive performance as I went through this process. And for that I used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-disk-speed-test/id425264550?mt=12">Blackmagic Disk Speed Test</a> which is available for free on the Mac App Store.</p>
<p>Each disk in my original setup had about 190 MB/s read/write speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/555d71e507.jpg" alt="Individual hard disk performance in Thunderbay 4."></p>
<p>The RAID 0 gave me about 300-320 MB/s. I forgot to speed test it before I removed it, but that’s what I recall from back when I first set it up.</p>
<p>In the intermediate setup with the LaCie enclosure I got about 250 MB/s write and 270 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/db8b2160a7.jpg" alt="SSD inside LaCie enclosure."></p>
<p>Once the drive tray arrived, I moved the SSD over to that and into the Thunderbay for the final setup where I’m now getting about 350 MB/s write and about 380 MB/s read speed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/7d7e7f5628.jpg" alt="SSD in Thunderbay."></p>
<p>I may be able to extract some more performance from this SSD by making some other purchases and changes, but I don’t feel compelled to do that at this time. This is better than what I had, and quite acceptable for my use. In fact I felt totally comfortable moving my iCloud Photo library over to it as well. This freed up about a third of my internal drive storage.</p>
<p>I could’ve done this sooner but the tradeoff of storage size vs. price didn’t seem worth it. In the future I may keep an eye on the price of such drives and pick up at sale to upgrade more of my Thunderbay drives.</p>
<p>And in the foolhardy-comparison-department, here’s the crazy fast speed on the internal SSD on my iMac (Retina 5K, 27”, 2017 model).</p>

<p>Two and a half years ago, my lower back had gotten so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t walk for more than a few minutes at a time without having to stop to sit or squat. Then came surgery, recovery, return of ability, and progression from there on. Yesterday I hiked up <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Dog_Mountain_Hike">Dog Mountain</a>. It was the most strenuous hike I&rsquo;ve ever done. And as I sit here all sore the next day, I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful to be able to do that.</p>
<p>Due to it&rsquo;s incredible popularity, and limited parking, the Forest Service has been issuing permits for weekend days. Jenni bought ours a while ago, and we have been making small preparations ever since. Purchasing some gear (<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/148595/rei-co-op-flash-22-print-pack">backpack</a>, <a href="https://hydrapak.com/products/shape-shift-3-liter">water reservoir</a>, hiking poles), and going on light to moderate hikes starting in early Spring. Although we didn&rsquo;t go on any hike for over a month before this, and that was a mistake.</p>
<p>We arrived at the trailhead just before 9:30am, met up with our friends, and started the hike a few minutes later. About half a mile up is a &ldquo;difficulty fork&rdquo; 😂</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/41ab47c447.jpg" alt="Group at difficulty fork"></p>
<p>For the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/57ee4dfe13.jpg" alt="Tree in the forest"></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fd6f11f750.jpg" alt="Mossy, dreamy forest"></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/2220be6561.jpg" alt="Double trunks"></p>
<p>Halfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/d77e20366b.jpg" alt="Vista of river"></p>
<p>For the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/01d37e049d.jpg" alt="Emerging into the clearance"></p>

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/4fd95d3143.jpg" alt="Wildflower photography on the edge"></p>
<p>The views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.</p>

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/631daf21e2.jpg" alt="Lunch at the top"></p>
<p>As we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html">Coyote Wall hike</a> from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/fc8ebfc65d.jpg" alt="Stretches on the trail. Photo by Jenni."></p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/90ddff0bac.jpg" alt="Heading back down"></p>
<p>Heading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1ab443d81.jpg" alt="Staggered view of the group"></p>
<p>All in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I&rsquo;m grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I&rsquo;m also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m feeling a love-hate relationship with activity streaks. While it is nice to have a streak and motivating to keep it going, I feel some anxiety coming along with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/26478fd52c.jpg" alt="March activity streak"></p>
<p>So, in an effort to avoid the unhealthy side effects, I am going to willfully break streaks.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e08e076050.jpg" alt="April activity streak"></p>
<p>This one has gone for some time. And today I&rsquo;m ending it.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/bb473b1bda.jpg" alt="May activity streak"></p>
<p>A positive effect of a streak is that it helps to develop a habit, and I&rsquo;d like to think that it has been the case this time. Let&rsquo;s see if that lasts.</p>
<p>P.S. For those unfamiliar, these charts show the activity tracking that is done by my <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d imagined that the plywood would be 1/2&quot; thick, but after some discussion with Jenni, we decided to go for the <em>chonk</em> look that was distinctive of the <a href="https://samgrover.com/2019/03/25/a-tabletop-shelfbox.html">tabletop shelf/box</a> I made a couple of months ago. This lowered the costs as well since I already had  enough scraps of the baltic birch plywood. All I needed was the dark walnut stain, a birch dowel, and hanging hardware. The mail holders are held together by glue, and attached to the back by screws drilled in from behind. The pegs are held in by glue. There were a couple other changes as evident from the sketch and the photo of the final piece.</p>
<p>The groove detail in the pegs was Jenni&rsquo;s idea. I tried a couple of ways to cut it out and landed upon just keeping the table saw blade low and using my crosscut sled to spin the dowel in place over the blade. That worked wonderfully!</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e2e7935f06.jpg" alt="Groove detail in pegs" title="Groove detail in pegs"></p>
<p>I finished the build a few weeks ago but the hardware I bought to hang it didn&rsquo;t work well. Then other things took up some time so I finally procured some new hardware and hung it up this week. We&rsquo;re both very happy with how it turned out.</p>
<p>And in parting, here&rsquo;s a photo of the old organizer trying hard to keep up.</p>

<p>Last weekend we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Coyote_Wall_Hike">Coyote Wall</a>. Jenni and I had never been to this hike before but our friends were familiar with it.</p>
<p>There are multiple trails that meet each other at various points. Some are gentle slopes, while others are steeper. One can pick and choose paths based on how much of a workout one wants and switch that around as needed.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/0ed951ee0d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are beautiful vistas all along the way to the top of the wall. I could see myself bringing family and friends here that are not used to hiking much, to just go for a bit, enjoy the views, and head back.</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c9bc70af23.jpg" alt="">

<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/e3a9317ab9.jpg" alt="Herbie was happy to lead us for a bit"></p>
<p>There are cute little waterfalls and streams as well along the way.</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/8ae92658b4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Spring flowers, sunny weather, and spotty clouds, made everything look a lot more beautiful.</p>

<p>At the top, we hung out for a bit to have snacks and enjoy the views some more.</p>

<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/a1221a6215.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the way down we took the steeper route for a bit. Some folks were mountain biking along the cliff and down the steep trails, which was incredible to watch but not something I see myself doing 😅</p>
<p><img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/77c43ee5df.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://samgrover.com/uploads/2019/c48e3a44fa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I can see myself coming back to this hike again in the spring, and probably in other seasons as well.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">Day One</a> for some time now. I like it for a lot of reasons, and it&rsquo;s working out great. So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href="https://foursquare.com">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>
<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>
<p>It makes calls to the <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>
<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href="https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>

			 <p>I signed up for <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">Setapp</a> for a free trial week. Setapp is an app subscription service for macOS where you sign up for $10 a month to gain full access to a catalog of over 100 apps.</p>
<p>This is not a review of Setapp, but rather my initial experience with it after having heard about it a few times on the <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast. Many of apps in the Setapp catalog are well known and as such I was already aware of them. But there are several that are new to me.</p>
<p>Apps that I found myself using often during the trial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marked</li>
<li>Mindnode</li>
<li>Flume</li>
<li>Timing</li>
<li>iStat Menus</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:</p>
<ul>
<li>WiFi Explorer</li>
<li>World Clock Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:</p>
<ul>
<li>CleanMyMac X</li>
<li>IconJar</li>
<li>Luminar Flex</li>
</ul>
<p>Apps that are included in Setapp but which I&rsquo;ve previously bought individually and use anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screens</li>
<li>Paw</li>
<li>Sip</li>
</ul>
<p>So with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the <em>potential</em> of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their <a href="https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000890969-Setapp-applications">stated goal</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn&rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.</p>
<p>If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8">select here to use my referral code</a>.</p>

<p>Last Saturday we went hiking at <a href="https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Angels_Rest_Hike">Angel&rsquo;s Rest</a> in the gorge. I&rsquo;ve been on this hike several times and always enjoy it. It is only a thirty minute drive from home, and offers great views and a good workout.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/88bb5df549.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This trail, along with many others had been closed for over a year since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Creek_Fire">Eagle Creek Fire</a>, and had reopened last fall.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a49110943e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>All the way from the trailhead to the viewpoint on the top of the cliff there were charred trees. I&rsquo;ve never hiked through a place devastated by fire before, so it was a new an interesting experience from that regard.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/977f3a474e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2aea63ac05.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Some areas on the trail were a bit muddy with puddles but mostly it was fine.</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/daffebc942.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/3263620192.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Jenni wanted a shelf in the kitchen to organize things a little better and I wanted to make different kinds of boxes. That&rsquo;s how this came to be.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a beginner woodworker and always on the lookout for new projects that I can use as an excuse to learn new skills, and let&rsquo;s be honest, to buy new tools. For this project I ended up buying a new blade for my table saw. One that has teeth with flat tips to make a flat cut, so that the finger joints fit snugly.</p>
<p>I also made a new tool, or as they call it in woodworking, a jig. I made a crosscut sled for my table saw, and that was very useful in making the 232 cuts for the finger joints on this box. That required some patience since you have to set things up correctly, make sure the sides are properly aligned, and not make adjustments until you&rsquo;ve made all the cuts. I used some scraps to make a few joints, and messed that up a bit, but that led to this working out fine. Although at one point I dropped one of the sides and broke a couple of the end finger joints on it. I made sure they were on the back when I put it all together. 😉</p>
<p><img src="http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/de49815b3c.jpg" alt="Finger joint detail"></p>
<p>Jenni picked the interior color. The paint company called it Salmon. I constructed the whole box before applying paint, so that step was a little awkward, but it turned out alright. Lesson learned, <em>I think</em>.  We decided to keep the plywood edges showing, so I ended up finishing those, and the exterior, with some clear satin polyurethane. Oh, the material was baltic birch plywood, which as you can see has a lot of layers.</p>
<p>Many parts of this were great learning experiences. Not all joints came out equally well but they were acceptable. Making the crosscut sled took longer than making this box but it was totally worth it. I&rsquo;d been wanting to make one for a while and I look forward to using it for many projects to come.</p>

			 <p>On 11th February in 2015, I decided to buy a house in Portland.</p>
<p>At the time I was working on my laptop at Hivolt, a coffee shop in New Orleans. I ordered a cup of pourover coffee named Burundi Buziraguhindwa. The menu described it as “natural sundried, juicy, strawberry, raspberry”. Turned out to be one of the best coffees I’ve ever had. It was the catalyst, because a few minutes later I had made the decision. When I told Jenni about it, she started calling it “magic coffee”. I love her.</p>
<p>Fast forward to August. My cross country road trip has ended, and I’m back in Portland. I’ve been talking to friends about buying a house, and looking for an agent. Amber recommends Laurie Gilmer. I meet Laurie and the house search begins. Two weeks later I make my first offer. She suggests I write a “love letter”, so I do. It doesn’t work out.</p>
<p>About two months pass. I see a bunch of houses. I make an offer. It doesn’t work out. Four days later I make one more offer. It doesn’t work out. The love letter is getting better all the time, I think.</p>
<p>Another month passes. Another offer. I really wanted that one. Nopes. Two months pass. I see a bunch more houses. Another offer. I really really wanted that one. Same story.</p>
<p>With every offer I got sleepless nights and elevated stress. Prices of houses in Portland have gone up by 12% over the last year. That trend goes back a couple of years. Each time it didn’t work out, I wondered if I would be able to buy a house at all.</p>
<p>Tick tock. It’s leap day 2016. Laurie informs me of a house that is being prepared to go on the market so we go see it a couple days later. I like it. On 3rd March I make the offer. On the 4th, it is accepted. 😱</p>
<p>Five days ago, on 11th April, I got the keys to the house. I’m so happy and excited, even though I suspect that it hasn’t fully sunk in. I’ve never bought a house before, and except for six months, I’ve never lived in a single family home my whole life. I can’t wait to move in next week.</p>

			 <p>It was less than a year ago that we said hello to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yoshi<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Unfortunately and unexpectedly now it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Yoshi started to show symptoms of great discomfort yesterday morning and we noticed blood in his urine shortly before noon. We immediately called his regular vet but they were about to close and asked us to go to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Laurelhurst Veterinary Hospital<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (LVH) instead. So off we went. After his examination the doctor informed us that he is having urinary tract issues. He&rsquo;s had other health issues earlier this year. The doctor informed us that since he is having these issues really early in his life, he will need constant medical attention and care in the future. Their best treatment recommendation greatly exceeded what we can afford right now. Combined with other unexpected financial events from this summer and the expected upcoming travels, it soon became apparent that we would have to make a hard decision. We informed the doctor of our predicament. She offered that they have a process in place to adopt a pet in such a circumstance, to nurse them back to health and put them up for adoption. With great sadness we decided to surrender Yoshi to their care. This way he gets the best, immediate, and adequate care and will find a new home with someone who can address his future needs as well. There are no words for our heartfelt gratitude to the folks at the LVH for adopting him into their care.</p>
<p>Yoshi was my first and only pet. The love that I have for him grew over time, took me by surprise, and has left me with a heavy heart. I miss him dearly and will cherish the memory of the time I had with him.</p>

			 <p>This blog post is long overdue and if you&rsquo;ve been following me on Twitter of Facebook, this is old news for you and you can just go ahead and skip to the last paragraph.</p>
<p>In March I left Intel to start working at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Small Society<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This has been an interesting and welcome change in my life and career. I was working on really cool computer security research at Intel Labs. However, on the side, I was gaining strong interest in developing apps with Cocoa on the Mac and iPhone OS platform ever since I started working on that over a year ago.</p>
<p>When I started to look around for a place to work on iPhone apps, Small Society was on the top of that list. Based in Portland, they have created apps for some of the leading brands in the world, including Starbucks, Whole Foods, Zipcar and Obama &lsquo;08. In fact the first draft of this post is being written on the iPad using the WordPress iPad app developed for Automattic by Small Society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been an interesting seven weeks since I joined and I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying the work that I&rsquo;m doing and the people I&rsquo;m working with. We&rsquo;ve just hired two new people this week and are looking to hire a senior Cocoa developer.

<p>This book is a treatise on human culture, with an emphasis on faith and spirituality. It is sci-fi as set in contemporary 21st century. The book can feel a bit dated, and it helps to imagine the US in the 60s to get some perspective. I particularly enjoyed the early experiences of Mike Smith (the &ldquo;Man from Mars&rdquo;) as he encounters human civilization for the first time and tries his best to &ldquo;grok&rdquo; it. His discoveries present interesting quirks of humanity that make one chuckle and laugh. Laughter itself makes a revealing impression on Mike.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve had my suspicions that I would enjoy having a cat as a pet. A month ago those suspicions were confirmed, and now I have my first pet ever.</p>
<p>Liz and I had the pleasure of hanging out in Kaua&rsquo;i for about a week (See pictures <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!). We stayed at some friends' place while they were on vacation. There were two house cats around, Woodrow and Wilson. At the end of that week I realized that I really enjoyed having a pet around. Liz had been keen on the idea for a while, so we decided to look for a kitty to adopt as soon as we got back.</p>
<p>She <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tweeted about it<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->got a response<!-- raw HTML omitted --> within twenty-four hours. Twenty days later, Yoshi arrived at our place. He is about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ten<!-- raw HTML omitted --> eight weeks old and in the last week has learned to use the litter and become comfy in our apartment. He&rsquo;s very entertaining and we&rsquo;re having a great time having him around.</p>

			 <p>Sometime last week, Liz and I saw Martin Scorsese’s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Aviator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a biographical film about Howard Hughes. At the end of the movie I remarked that the Hercules flying boat, designed by Hughes, and shown in the film is on permanent display in our Oregon neighborhood. A few minutes of online searching later we decided to go check it out at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in McMinnville on the weekend.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, after a brief breakfast stop at a local bagel joint, we drove out towards the museum. We passed beautiful hills draped with vineyards and wineries. Later in the day we learned that these were the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chehalem Mountains<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dundee Hills<!-- raw HTML omitted --> regions of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Willamette Valley Wineries<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. We hadn’t been there before and were delighted to see it. Eyeing all the wine tasting signs we decided to stop at some of the wineries on our way back.</p>
<p>We got to the museum about an hour before noon. It is located across the road from the airport in McMinnville. There are two museum buildings which house the aviation and space museums and a third building has an IMAX theater. Some aircraft are displayed in spaces along the buildings too. We only visited the aviation museum, choosing to return to the space museum on another day, perhaps after they install one of the retiring space shuttles, which they plan to do.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is clear upon looking at the aviation museum and the time spent inside it that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hercules<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is their star attraction. It takes up most of the space and even though there are about a hundred other aircrafts spanning the hundred year history of powered flight, they all appear negligible next to it. The critics of this magnificent aircraft, the largest of its time, called it the “Spruce Goose”. Liz and I were disappointed that this name, which was despised by Hughes, was the one used prominently by the museum. Their website address uses it; they sport it on gift store items; and they even have a winery that makes wine branded the same.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Even in their relative smallness, the other aircrafts on display offer a great collection of beautiful airplanes, helicopters, balloon-basket, a Wright 1903 Flyer replica and even a model skeleton of the wing-like device sketched by Leonardo DaVinci. There were some charming touches to the museum. Sitting next to a WW2 bomber was an old man who had flown one of those for thirty missions over France and Germany when he was eighteen. Alongside some planes were accurate models. One depicted intricately the machine gun wing assembly on a WW2 fighter. Next to the Hercules was a model of it used in the Scorsese film and donated to the museum.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On our way back, we checked out a few wineries, tasted the wines at a couple of them and bought some at one in Dundee. I haven’t been a fan of wine most of my life, having sided with beer whenever presented a choice, but in recent times I have started to experiment. Now, having had some really delicious ones, I’m starting to become a fan to the extent that I know a bit about what I like and what I don&rsquo;t like. My wine vocabulary remains minimal and will probably stay that way unless my interest in it skyrockets.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We drove back to Portland through a different, but similarly scenic route. To top off the lovely Sunday, which was filled with expected and unexpected pleasures, that night we saw Terry Jones’ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik the Viking<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It featured a different kind of flying boat and was quite hilarious.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve returned to using Netflix this year and it&rsquo;s working out great for Liz and me, both film lovers. Here are some thoughts on my recent Netflix experience.</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that when Netflix shows me ratings for a movie that I haven&rsquo;t rated (the red stars), it is not showing me what I thought that was. The red stars show me what Netflix thinks I will rate the movie rather than the average of what others have rated. It is a prediction. This is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not news<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but is news to me. I don&rsquo;t like it. I&rsquo;d like to see the average rating given by others instead of the predicted rating for me. I&rsquo;ve taken to hovering over each film&rsquo;s title or image to get that information. It&rsquo;s annoying but doable and I prefer it to the misleading red stars.</p>
<p>Recently when Liz was away for a few weeks, I had a plan to watch a bunch of action flicks and such-like that I wanted to see and knew the she wouldn&rsquo;t want to see. Not that she isn&rsquo;t into action films; the other day we greatly enjoyed <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inglourious Basterds<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. So I browsed for those films that I had heard of and those that folks recommended, added them to my queue, and moved them to the top. Soon enough they started showing up and I had a great time catching up on that genre. Now that Liz is back, the queue is as it was before she left and I&rsquo;m faced with a slight problem. When I come across a film in the aforementioned genre, I would like to store it for another similar time in the future. However, I can&rsquo;t just add it to my queue without constant annoying maintenance. I&rsquo;d like a feature using which I can make a list of movies called “Sam&rsquo;s Must-See Action Flix”. When Liz travels, I can make this list my active queue in one click. And then one-click should return the active queue to the regularly scheduled list when she returns. Simple.</p>
<p>The “Watch Instantly” feature of streaming movies is most excellent. I love it, despite the fact that it causes my browser to crash once each time I use it. I&rsquo;ve been using it to see movies I&rsquo;ve enjoyed before but not seen in a long time and also for those times when you just want to see something right away but aren&rsquo;t in the mood for the DVD lying on the table. It would be most awesome if it worked directly with my PlayStation 3 but from what I&rsquo;ve read that is not likely to happen anytime soon.</p>

			 <p>A couple of weeks ago I finished reading Michael Pollan&rsquo;s <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The book is about food production and agriculture in the US. It is also about man&rsquo;s relation to food and to the culture of eating. This is not a review of the book, but rather a summary of my thoughts on this subject as it relates to my personal health and habits.</p>
<p>Many years ago I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Size Me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Following that I stopped eating at McDonald&rsquo;s and reduced my consumption of fast food in general. It wasn&rsquo;t until I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->King Corn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Future of Food<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the reality of industrial agriculture began to sink in. I was increasingly disgusted by what I was eating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been altering my food habits towards ones that I believe will support the goal of a healthier life. Habits, that were encouraged by my parents while I was growing up, but those that I easily ignored in my adult independence. My mom taught me that just about anything is good in moderation but nothing is good in excess. Pollan&rsquo;s observations on food show just how much excess is involved in industrial food. Observations of my own diet revealed that I was having too much meat and processed food and not enough vegetables, whole grains and fruits. I also found a large amount of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HFCS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in my diet, mostly from soda, but also, and this was a surprise to me, from ketchup and other products.</p>
<p>Throughout my twenties, I didn&rsquo;t think twice about what I was eating as long as it tasted good, and often, fast and convenient. My younger body could take that abuse without much consequence. My older body won&rsquo;t tolerate abuse as it gets confused and transformed by the bad food I eat. It is imperative that I live a healthy life and for that it is necessary that I eat healthy food. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Having moved to the US from India, I&rsquo;ve always admired the nutrition label on foods sold here. What I had often ignored was the list of ingredients. Now, more than ever, I find that information very valuable when eating or buying food. Labeling is important and I would like to see it become even more descriptive to capture the source of ingredients and to their status as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GMOs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m grateful to those that research information about food and agriculture and seek to have it readily accessible.</p>
<p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve been eating much less meat. I have eliminated HFCS from my diet. I have greatly reduced the consumption of processed food and increased the consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. I acknowledge that as I seek to minimize my consumption of unhealthy food I may occasionally give in to the desires of speed, convenience or taste. Having Liz in my life has significantly helped to reintroduce and encourage healthier eating habits. Her food ethic is much stronger than mine and she is acutely conscious of what she consumes.</p>
<p>As an omnivore I can eat many things, but I won&rsquo;t just eat any thing.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve just released Avatari version 0.2.2. This is a minor release. It preserves avatar file type when uploading to a service. It also improves and simplifies the user interface design when adding a new account. Many thanks to my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@ubercolin<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for his suggestions regarding these improvements. For a complete list of changes, please see the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Release Notes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

			 <p>Mike Johnston, over at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T.O.P<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, writes interesting posts quite often. He has recently written a couple of them that hit close to home. They are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Leica as Teacher<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why It Has To Be a Leica<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Mike suggests a training program using the Leica for a year to shoot <!-- raw HTML omitted -->B&amp;W<!-- raw HTML omitted --> film extensively and to edit and critique oneself on the photos taken. I&rsquo;ve tried to do exactly that over the last two years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are some differences, of course. My camera has been a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bessa R2A<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;ve been using only that camera with a 50mm prime lens since January 2007. The Bessa is like a cheaper version of a Leica. Most of the points that Mike mentions in the second post apply to the Bessa too.</p>
<p>Certainly, I haven&rsquo;t been as prolific as Mike suggests. Much has happened in my life since then and other interests have sometimes taken priority in spare time. As of today I have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->362 photos on Flickr<!-- raw HTML omitted --> taken with this camera and lens pair. That&rsquo;s an average of about three selected photos per week, although in reality there were bursts of activity when I was on vacation. About half of those photos are B&amp;W. I typically haven&rsquo;t thought in terms of color unless it felt quite essential, and have preferred B&amp;W film for the most part.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The gist of the matter is that this is a really good exercise. In the end, like Mike says,</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This gels with what Malcolm Gladwell has written in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Outliers<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and with my own experience. What matters most is that you put a lot of time and effort into it. The constraints Mike suggests help to make the exercise even more focused, pun unintended. It&rsquo;s definitely not the only exercise out there but I sincerely believe that if you were to do this, it would greatly benefit your photographic eye. I can surely feel it and perhaps my photography shows it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When I started using my Bessa, I dumped my DSLR and haven&rsquo;t missed it since. Having said that, I think I&rsquo;m getting weary of having a film based workflow as my primary one. I&rsquo;m still hoping that a nice digital rangefinder will come along or that I will find it reasonable to invest in a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leica M8<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Until then I may try the new <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sigma DP2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It looks quite promising. I&rsquo;ll keep an eye out for the news and reviews and look at photos from it for a couple of months before deciding.</p>

			 <p>Yea, the last few posts on this blog have all been about Avatari. Life, as usual, is way more varied. Here&rsquo;s a recap of some travels and photos from the last few months.</p>
<p>Late last year, Liz and I traveled to Asia. We visited her Nepalese home near Kathmandu, had our second wedding of the year in New Delhi and then went to Bali for our honeymoon. That&rsquo;s a whole &lsquo;nother blog post that one of us will eventually write on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our blog<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Oh, but the pictures are ready to go in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Asia 2008 collection<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Flickr.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our first trip this year was during the last week of April. Liz and I went on a road trip in the Colorado plateau area. We flew in to Las Vegas and drove to Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park. It was an amazing set of places to see with wondrous natural landscapes; the product of water, stone and time. We spent four nights camping and three in hotels. An exploration of that trip will also be in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->our blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> soon, I promise! Once again, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->photos are ready<!-- raw HTML omitted --> :-)</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>These two trips have been my primary outlet in taking photos over the past several months. I&rsquo;m quite happy with the resulting pictures. I am, however, starting to feel tired of using film and the related workflow and cost. I hope I can make the transition to a decent digital rangefinder sometime over the next year or so although I will have to save up for one of those!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tomorrow Liz and I will be going to Bend in central Oregon for this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Memorial Day<!-- raw HTML omitted --> weekend and I&rsquo;m hoping to explore new places and take a bunch of more photos. So, stay tuned for those!</p>
<p>I have a couple more ideas for blog posts so hopefully the next one will be sooner rather than later. In the meanwhile, feel free to follow along at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@samgrover<!-- raw HTML omitted --> where I can be found posting much more frequently.</p>

<p>You wanted AddressBook and iChat support. It is here!</p>
<p>I wanted more web services to adopt an API for uploading avatars. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shizzow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> responded with enthusiasm. That support is here too!</p>
<p>By enabling AddressBook and/or iChat support, entries appear in the account list for each of those. When you are ready to update your avatar, just select them if you want to update those too.</p>
<p>If you use iChat for Google Talk, then setting your avatar in iChat will update your avatar on Google&rsquo;s servers the next time you connect or immediately if you are already connected. Google then updates your avatar across all their services including Gmail, Google Profile, etc.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just updated Avatari to the latest version using the newly added auto-update feature. This has been made super simple through the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sparkle<!-- raw HTML omitted --> framework for Cocoa. After you download this version, the application should auto-update with each new release. There is also a &ldquo;Check for updates&hellip;&rdquo; feature in the application menu for manual checks.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@bsneed<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the idea to support AddressBook and iChat and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@ryansnyder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@shizzow<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for responding to my call for an API within a matter of days!</p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks to all of you for the enthusiastic response to my first Cocoa application! I hope you like this release and continue to provide me with your feedback on my Gmail address, samgrover. I will do my best to deliver.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Download Avatari<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Requires Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). Runs on Intel and PowerPC based Mac computers. Supports multiple accounts on Twitter, FriendFeed, Shizzow and your Mac&rsquo;s AddressBook, iChat.</p>

<p>I keep my avatar the same most of the time but every now and then I would replace it for a short period to represent a holiday or a cause or some event. When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>I made Avatari to solve this problem. It currently supports multiple accounts on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Twitter<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FriendFeed<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. When I came up with this idea, I found that Twitter already had an API for uploading an avatar but FriendFeed didn&rsquo;t. I requested the folks at FriendFeed to create an API for me, and to my pleasant surprise, they had one ready in twenty days. Thanks guys! I hope to add more services in the future.</p>
<p>My other motivation for making Avatari is to teach myself Cocoa programming. I had hoped to make something useful while familiarizing myself with Cocoa. It&rsquo;s working great and I&rsquo;m hoping to advance my knowledge of Cocoa software development with continued effort.</p>
<p>Last week I presented Avatari to the folks at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Portland CocoaHeads<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and tonight I presented it at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Demolicious<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;d like to thank all the folks at either event for their feedback, ideas and encouragement regarding this project.</p>
<p>Special thanks to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Giglielmo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for sharing <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the photo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> used in the logo under the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Attribution-Share Alike license<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to my wife, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Liz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for transforming it into the application logo.</p>
<p>I hope you like using Avatari. Let me know what I can do to make it better. You can reach me at my Gmail address, samgrover or via <!-- raw HTML omitted -->@samgrover<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

<p>I started with the wonderful Super Mario Galaxy and it was the only Wii game I played until a couple of months ago. Then, for five days each, I rented Transformers, Super Smash Brothers Brawl, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, one after another. And although I didn&rsquo;t really get in to Brawl, I thoroughly enjoyed the other two.</p>
<p>Then came October, and my awesome mother-in-law completely surprised me with two Wii games for my birthday. Pirates of the Carribean: At World&rsquo;s End and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Both are based on movies that I haven&rsquo;t seen. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed The Mummy more than Pirates.</p>
<p>Then came November, and keeping in mind that Liz and I will be off to Asia during Christmas, my mom-in-law sent our presents early. Guess what I got, among other things? Yea, that&rsquo;s right, two more Wii games! Iron Man and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Each based on a movie that I have seen multiple times. Awesome! I haven&rsquo;t played Fantastic Four yet, but Iron Man has been fun so far.</p>
<p>Next week Liz and I leave for a vacation to Asia, but when I&rsquo;m back in January, I&rsquo;ll sure have a bunch of Wii games to play :)</p>

			 <p>I got sick of reposting to Twitter what I had just posted to FriendFeed. I was doing that to enable conversations in both networks. I tried twitterfeed and Yahoo! Pipes, before deciding to just write a tool to do exactly what I wanted.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is a tool to convert a FriendFeed post into a tweet and post it to Twitter. It does so while ensuring that the tweet is within the character limit and incorporates any comment made by the user when posting on FriendFeed. It also inspects the link in the post to shorten and add to the tweet as necessary.</p>
<p>ff2tweet is written in Python and I run it as a cron job on a server. It uses the FriendFeed and Twitter APIs to accomplish its task. It does what I wanted to do but it is a quick hack and there is definitely room for improvement. All feedback appreciated. The code is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->available on github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Join in!</p>

			 <p>As I mentioned in my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->last post<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, (over two months ago!) I went to Portugal for a trip towards the end of July. I was attending the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SECRYPT<!-- raw HTML omitted --> conference and presenting my paper there. All I knew about Porto, was what I read on Wikipedia and other places online. I was looking forward to a cute historic European city and that&rsquo;s exactly what I got.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I reached there on a Friday afternoon, quite jet-lagged. The hotel (Hotel Melia Gaia Porto) was in the area south of the Douro river called Vila Nova De Gaia. That evening I got food at a nearby place and explored about a mile around the hotel, partly in search of a wall adapter for my laptop power cord. Walking around Gaia reminded me of India, especially my maternal grandma&rsquo;s neighborhood in Delhi. The streets are narrow. The cars are small. Old rustic architecture is mixed with modern glassy facades.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The conference was at the hotel and ran from Saturday thru Tuesday. Each day, I would attend sessions until about 6pm and then head out to explore the city. On Saturday I took a leisurely photowalk towards the city center. As I got closer to the river, historic buildings appeared and this time I was reminded of Bombay, which has a heavy Portugese influence. The extent of that influence was more than I realized. I rediscovered words that I thought were of Indian origin, only to find that they were in fact Portugese. In Bombay, the word for bread is &lsquo;pao&rsquo; and the word for potato is &lsquo;batata&rsquo;. Both of those are Portugese words. This discovery surprised my friends and family too.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Over the next few days I explored several areas around the Porto city center. The metro was very convenient. On my last day there I went to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Casa da Música<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is an interesting building with non-perpendicular corners and a variety of unique rooms. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it was completely open to the public for free. You could just walk into and all around its various rooms, even into the main auditorium. You could sit at a Steinway grand piano and play to your heart&rsquo;s content and no one would bother. I didn&rsquo;t because I don&rsquo;t know how but a guy was doing just that.</p>
<p>Overall the trip was productive and pleasant, definitely whetting my appetite to explore more of Europe. My photos from the trip are in the slideshow below. You can follow it to the photos on flickr where you can view their location on a map.</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s plenty going on.</p>
<p>My sister and her daughter came by to visit me from India last month. They were here for about a week and we all had a great time going around the Portland metro area and nearby to the gorge and coast. Here they are at Cannon Beach.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I got a paper accepted to a conference called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SECRYPT<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I will be going to present it at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Porto, Portugal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> during the last few days of July. I just applied for a Visa and am looking forward to my first trip to Europe.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ignite Portland<!-- raw HTML omitted --> 3 happened last night. This time Liz was a speaker. She spoke about her experiences of traveling to Afghanistan. She has a ton of stories and did an excellent job of squeezing a five minute rapid fire inspirational talk from them. There was a good variety of topics, just like at the last Ignite Portland, which made the evening quite entertaining. This time we went to the after party at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Imbibe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and had a great time with friends, old and new. You can see her slides and video right here. They go quite well together.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And lastly for now, Liz and I decided to start a blog together to document our adventures. I kicked it off tonight with a basic theme and a first post about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how we met<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Check it out and subscribe for more stories in the future.</p>

<p>I had wanted to add a feature to remember a user&rsquo;s past searches but was too lazy to implement that in PHP. With the new version, I get user logins automatically.

<p>Even in those young days I had heard of the music of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ustad Zakir Hussain<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Zakir is regarded as the foremost player of the Tabla in the world. He has achieved unparalleled recognition and mastery with the Tabla and is a household name in India. Last night, Liz and I went to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Schnitz<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for a concert by Zakir Hussain and the Masters of Percussion. It is an annual event hosted by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kalakendra<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The group does a tour each year and the musicians change regularly. It was such beautiful and wide ranging music from a dozen different instruments of various Indian Classical schools. I was enthralled by the solo and group performances, especially the Tabla, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sarangi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sitar<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we got to meet and chat with Zakir. He had such a jovial and warm demeanor. This was my first time at the event and I hope to go again.</p>

			 <p>For the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve had a new personal assistant, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sandy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I came to her after trying Backpack, Remember the Milk, Stikkit and others that I don&rsquo;t even remember any more. She&rsquo;s the best one I&rsquo;ve had so far. She makes me want her more. So far my girlfriend is cool with that, even though Sandy lives right here in Portland.</p>
<p>This weekend I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Helvetica<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I got excited when I noticed that Movie Madness had it on their list but it was never in stock when I got there. On Saturday it wasn&rsquo;t on the shelves either, but Liz suggested that I peruse the un-shelved DVDs and there it was. I&rsquo;ve never thought about the history behind types. This film was enjoyable just for that. And there&rsquo;s a lot more about typography and graphic design in there. To top it all, the film is set to a really cool soundtrack.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I hung out with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beer and Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --> peeps at the Lucky Lab on Hawthorne. The meeting was great. We touched on several topics and Justin has <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nicely summarized them<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m looking forward to more such interactions. See photos <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you&rsquo;ve noticed an increase in my blog posts over the last few days, it can be attributed to some extent to the wonderful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->MarsEdit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is a joy to compose and manage blog posts in it. I&rsquo;m still trying it out but at this point is looks like I&rsquo;ll be buying it well before the trial period runs out in about a month.</p>

			 <p>It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, &ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels&rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Bessa<!-- raw HTML omitted --> exclusively, and I love it.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CameraQuest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->early experience with a rangefinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canonet QL17 G-III<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Over the last year I&rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Flickr photostream<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That&rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would&rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Burning Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->India<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.</p>
<p>I like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven&rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that&rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I&rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I updated this blog. About ten months. I&rsquo;ve been an intern at Intel during that period and I recently joined as an employee.</p>
<p>Also, now it&rsquo;s been one year since I moved to the SE Portland. I like it here. I have a hour-or-so long commute each way on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->TriMet<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which isn&rsquo;t terribly bad as it gives me time to read. However, public transit doesn&rsquo;t work too well when there are more things to do in a day, especially in different parts of town. Even though my schedule at work is quite flexible, public transit can become a bottleneck. That occurs when I want to do more than go to work in the morning and return home in the evening. I thought that was sufficient excuse for me to go in for a car ;-) and placed an order for a new Mini Cooper S in April. I expect to have delivery within a month and am looking forward to that. It will be my first car.</p>
<p>My photography has been up and down during this time. In January, I sold off my Nikon D70S digital SLR and bought a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Voigtländer Bessa R2A<!-- raw HTML omitted --> film rangefinder. After playing with cameras and photography for a couple of years I had come to realize just the kind of camera that would work best for me. The Bessa fit that bill quite well. It was also quite affordable as compared to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->another option<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. My previous <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experience with a rangefinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was definitely a motivating factor. I will write more about my experiences with this camera in a future post.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Russ<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wanted to recreate the cover of The Beatles' <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abbey Road<!-- raw HTML omitted --> album cover along with his wife, Patty and son, Riley. He planned the shot and scouted for locations, narrowing them down to two. So, on a Sunday morning we went out to take the shot. We were a bit early for the chosen locations. The light wasn&rsquo;t right. After a brief time looking around, we decided to go get breakfast and then return to take the shots.</p>
<p>On our way to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LaurelThirst<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we spotted an intersection on Stark Street and as fate would have it, it was better than the others and just right for the shot. Russ parked his Bug on the wrong side of the road and we started taking shots. They walked through the intersection once and I took some sample shots. After correcting their spacing and rhythm, I took shots of a few more passes with digital and film cameras. About fifteen minutes later, accomodating for light traffic, we were done and headed for a tasty breakfast. I had never tried to recreate a photo before. This was fun, and hopefully I&rsquo;ll do more in the future. We left out some details, like Paul&rsquo;s cigarette, Ringo, etc.</p>
<p>After going through the photos, Russ and family selected this shot as their favorite. Click on the image to see the larger version on flickr. There you will also find a link to the exact location on a map.</p>

			 <p>Amazon started offering downloadable movies a couple of weeks ago. That&rsquo;s great, especially since they offer rentals. I prefer to rent movies since I usually only see a movie once. If I feel like watching it again and again, I would buy it. In that case, I wouldn&rsquo;t buy a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->restricted<!-- raw HTML omitted --> downloadable file and wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it either, especially with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->draconian agreements<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;d rather just buy the physical DVD at an affordable price. You can&rsquo;t just give a restricted file to a friend and say, &ldquo;Hey, check this out. It&rsquo;s cool&rdquo;. The same is true for restricted music.</p>
<p>The hassle of maintaining my own digital store and backing up stuff is another deterrent. Hard disks will fail, so one needs a more comprehensive backup policy than just saving the data onto a second disk. With movies, that&rsquo;s a lot of data. There&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;m going to put money into a backup system for that.
Amazon&rsquo;s videos won&rsquo;t play on the Mac, so I can&rsquo;t even rent it if I wanted to. That&rsquo;s another side-effect of the restrictions. Apple is also offering movie downloads through their iTunes  store, but they don&rsquo;t offer rentals. So, I&rsquo;m off to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Movie Madness<!-- raw HTML omitted --> these days. If someone figures out a convenient way to offer downloadable movie rentals, I&rsquo;ll sign on.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I don't have any major need for spreadsheets, so I'm definitely not inclined to buy some software for it. But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.</p>
<p>I started to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Spreadsheets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XLS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.</p>
<p>And now for the idle speculation part, which kinda builds on what I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first read<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a long time ago. This new product makes me wonder that with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->known<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and unknown components below their web applications, Google probably has a development platform for hosting applications on their infrastructure. I wonder if they would make it available to developers too. Let's call it the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nvironment for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ogle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->D<!-- raw HTML omitted -->evelopers, or eGoD ;-). They could potentially let eGoD applications reside on the developer's own hardware, but they can't really fulfill their &quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->mission<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot; if it's not on their own infrastructure*. A reason for developers to let Google host their eGoD applications may be to guarantee good performance by utilizing a large scale <!-- raw HTML omitted -->distributed system<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is managed and maintained by Google. Another reason would be that all eGoD applications would be &quot;local&quot; to each other and to Google services so if they wish to exchange information, they would be able to do so very efficiently. I've read time and again that infrastructure is one of Google's main strengths and I think that is absolutely true.</p>
<p>A Google branded word processor based on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Writely<!-- raw HTML omitted --> will surely come out soon. I don't know if these applications are the beginning of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->challenge to Microsoft Office<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, at least not until the technologies and interfaces are more mature. However they demonstrate the capability of this imaginary eGoD platform. Such a development and hosting environment is bound to be disruptive in the desktop application ecosphere. Google may go after a big slice of the pie with Office, leaving the niche products to the small developers. Just like Microsoft did with their platform, Windows.</p>
<ul>
<li>By the way, they provide <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Base<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for people to give them their <!-- raw HTML omitted -->deep web<!-- raw HTML omitted --> information.</li>
</ul>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I borrowed a rangefinder camera from a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->friend<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a couple of weeks ago. The camera is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canonet QL17 G-III<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I've gone through one roll on it and it's been fun to use so far. I had been using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->SLR<!-- raw HTML omitted --> cameras until now and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rangefinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is quite different in operation. The major difference being that the image viewed through the viewfinder is not the same as the one that is seen by the lens. In an SLR you see through the lens, so it's more of a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WYSIWYG<!-- raw HTML omitted --> interface. Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It's been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->raining again<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the last week, so I haven't had any chance to shoot more with this camera. Hopefully things will clear up next week!</p>

			 <p>I like reading, but unfortunately, I don't get much time to read for pleasure these days. Adding to that sorry state of affairs is the fact that I'm a slow reader. When I do read nowadays, it is more of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->non-fiction<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. On those rare occasions that I do read fiction, I love a good short story.</p>
<p>Apart from being concise, short stories stay focused and leave a lot to the imagination. They appeal to the minimalist in me. They build around a key idea or theme and my favorite kind have a twist or climax at the very end. An extreme and wonderful example is Ernest Hemmingway's six word story: &quot;For sale: Baby shoes. Never used&quot;.</p>
<p>Here are some short stories that I came across on the internet in recent times. I think they are marvelous and recommend them to you, my imaginary readers. One for each of you three :-D</p>

			 <p>I don&rsquo;t have a radio. On many occasions I&rsquo;ve heard people say good things about NPR and so recently I&rsquo;ve been listening to some of the podcasts offered by them. They are excellent programs and I thought I&rsquo;d recommend a couple to anyone interested in listening in.</p>
<p>The first is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All Songs Considered<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is hosted by Bob Boilen (sometimes in conversation with guests) and features newly available music from various artists. The selection is eclectic and I&rsquo;ve found some great new artists from listening to the show.</p>
<p>The second is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Science Friday<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It is hosted by Ira Flatow. He discusses various current issues in science with guests who are prominent members of the scientific community. The conversations are interesting and introduce me to a larger scientific domain than what I&rsquo;m used to hearing about in the computer science area.</p>
<p>They are both weekly shows, so it&rsquo;s not that hard to keep up. Check them out!</p>

			 <p>Ever since I switched recently and for a little while before that too I have been following news about Apple. There is an interesting article on Robert X. Cringley&rsquo;s &ldquo;I, Cringley&rdquo; page about the future of Apple following the creation of a separate iPod division. Mr. Cringley evaluates it in relation to a 20 year old quote from Steve Jobs. Interesting items include <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ldquo;What most people don’t know is that Apple, with the assistance of Intel, a few years ago ported all its software to run on Intel’s Pentium processors.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
