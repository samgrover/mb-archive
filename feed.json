This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/6981b709e9.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/6981b709e9.jpg\" alt=\"View of conference area from back and above. A large screen with the Apple logo is visible in the distance. There a number of rows of chairs in between. Tall steel grey pillars dominate the vertical space.\"></a></p>\n<p>I arrived about an hour before the keynote. After going through the security check, I made my way to Caffé Macs where the event was set up. There was food and beverages. I picked up some coffee, some overnight oats with blueberry compote, and a savory pastry. Once I was done with that I found spot amongst some Apple engineers just in time for the keynote to start.</p>\n<p>After the keynote was lunchtime. I walked round for a bit looking at all the food options before settling on the grilled chicken with salad. I took this over to the inner meadow where there were a number of tables set up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/b2c188c364.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/b2c188c364.jpg\" alt=\"A number of tables are set up in rows in a meadow with people seated at them. Rainbow arches are visible in the distance. A cloudy hazy sky above.\"></a></p>\n<p>I sat down randomly and started to eat and chat with others. Turned out I was sitting right next to an industrial designer on the Vision Pro, so the conversation was mostly about that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/10e7b90534.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/10e7b90534.jpg\" alt=\"Curved glass windows separate the outside from the inside. People walking around and seated on tables outside. Everything is reflected in glassy ceilings and awnings.\"></a></p>\n<p>Then it was time for the Platforms State of the Union. At first I went to the outside area by the main stage and sat on the fabric lounge chairs, but that was bothering my back so I came back inside to sit on a sturdier chair.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg\" alt=\"A number of people in blue T-shirts with WWDC23 written on their backs are watching a screen with a video playing.\"></a></p>\n<p>As I watched the video, I also noticed the space, how it was full of sunlight, large indoor trees, and expansive and seamlessly transitioning from inside to outside. And every bit of it was curved. This was certainly a unique space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/154449a030.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/154449a030.jpg\" alt=\"Curved ceilings and windows let in sunlight high above the hall.

I had previously signed up for walking tours of the inner meadow and of the ring building, but that system seemed to have not worked too well for Apple as they were now just organizing all that on a first come first served basis. I got in line for the inner meadow tour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg\" alt=\"A young man is sitting at a table outdoors under a shade structure.

Our first stop was by some fruit trees where a docent talked about all the fruit they grow and how it is all set up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg\" alt=\"A curved concave building with large glass windows is visible in the distance. Fruit trees are in the foreground.\"></a></p>\n<p>The second stop was by a shallow pond. In the center of the pond was a round plate that goes up and down. This creates a gentle wave that is imperceptible unless one is looking closely, but makes a definite wave crashing sound as it reached the edge of the pond. that was pretty cool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg\" alt=\"A large round pond with a couple of ducks near the center.

Over it is a cloudy sky.\"></a></p>\n<p>The third and final stop was by the rainbow arches where a different docent talked about how it came to be as originally a temporary sculpture that was later made permanent. Then we made our way back on the same path.</p>\n<p>Right after that I got in line for the building tour. This was very popular and there was a lot of management going on to get people into small batches and move them along as tour guides returned from their previous tour and started a new one. At this point it definitely felt like I was in line for a theme park ride.</p>\n<p>The ring tour took us upstairs to the third level from one side of Caffé Macs. Then to the inner side of the building, across the terrace overlooking the main event area and back down.</p>\n<p>At one point a docent talked about the structure of the building. Some interesting facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outer circumference is one mile. Inner circumference is 0.75 mile.</li>\n<li>There&rsquo;s a four feet quake zone all around the outside, so the whole building is capable of moving significantly in case of an earthquake.</li>\n<li>The two massive doors are the largest ever of their kind. And apparently super quiet when opening/closing.</li>\n<li>A lot of the dirt from digging up the foundation is piled up and forms the landscaping.</li>\n<li>The land is 80% greenery and 20% building. Previously it was the opposite.</li>\n<li>The roof hosts the largest solar installation on a building.</li>\n<li>The building temperature is maintained at a comfortable level by passive mechanisms most of the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cc2fc5b487.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cc2fc5b487.jpg\" alt=\"A view through the convex side of a curved glass window.

There we descended to a lower level where a gallery space had been set up showing photos and videos from behind the scenes of a project called <a href=\"https://mirage.place\"><em>Mirage</em></a>. There were even some samples of the cast glass made for the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/680384854f.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/680384854f.jpg\" alt=\"Glass awnings and windows are visible on three consecutive levels as viewed from the ground.

This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.\n\n[![View of conference area from back and above. A large screen with the Apple logo is visible in the distance. There a number of rows of chairs in between. Tall steel grey pillars dominate the vertical space.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/6981b709e9.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/6981b709e9.jpg)\n\nI arrived about an hour before the keynote. After going through the security check, I made my way to Caffé Macs where the event was set up. There was food and beverages. I picked up some coffee, some overnight oats with blueberry compote, and a savory pastry. Once I was done with that I found spot amongst some Apple engineers just in time for the keynote to start.\n\nAfter the keynote was lunchtime. I walked round for a bit looking at all the food options before settling on the grilled chicken with salad. I took this over to the inner meadow where there were a number of tables set up.\n\n[![A number of tables are set up in rows in a meadow with people seated at them. Rainbow arches are visible in the distance.

Turned out I was sitting right next to an industrial designer on the Vision Pro, so the conversation was mostly about that.\n\n[![Curved glass windows separate the outside from the inside. People walking around and seated on tables outside.

At first I went to the outside area by the main stage and sat on the fabric lounge chairs, but that was bothering my back so I came back inside to sit on a sturdier chair.\n\n[![A number of people in blue T-shirts with WWDC23 written on their backs are watching a screen with a video playing.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg)\n\nAs I watched the video, I also noticed the space, how it was full of sunlight, large indoor trees, and expansive and seamlessly transitioning from inside to outside. And every bit of it was curved. This was certainly a unique space.\n\n[![Curved ceilings and windows let in sunlight high above the hall. The tops of steel pillars and indoor trees are also visible.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/154449a030.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/154449a030.jpg)\n\n[![A view from above of people on the floor level.

I had previously signed up for walking tours of the inner meadow and of the ring building, but that system seemed to have not worked too well for Apple as they were now just organizing all that on a first come first served basis. I got in line for the inner meadow tour.\n\n[![A young man is sitting at a table outdoors under a shade structure. He is using an Apple computer from thirty to forty years ago.

Our first stop was by some fruit trees where a docent talked about all the fruit they grow and how it is all set up.\n\n[![A curved concave building with large glass windows is visible in the distance. Fruit trees are in the foreground.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg)\n\nThe second stop was by a shallow pond. In the center of the pond was a round plate that goes up and down. This creates a gentle wave that is imperceptible unless one is looking closely, but makes a definite wave crashing sound as it reached the edge of the pond. that was pretty cool.\n\n[![A large round pond with a couple of ducks near the center.

Then we made our way back on the same path.\n\nRight after that I got in line for the building tour. This was very popular and there was a lot of management going on to get people into small batches and move them along as tour guides returned from their previous tour and started a new one. At this point it definitely felt like I was in line for a theme park ride.\n\nThe ring tour took us upstairs to the third level from one side of Caffé Macs. Then to the inner side of the building, across the terrace overlooking the main event area and back down.\n\nAt one point a docent talked about the structure of the building. Some interesting facts:\n\n- Outer circumference is one mile. Inner circumference is 0.75 mile.\n- There's a four feet quake zone all around the outside, so the whole building is capable of moving significantly in case of an earthquake.\n- The two massive doors are the largest ever of their kind. And apparently super quiet when opening/closing.\n- A lot of the dirt from digging up the foundation is piled up and forms the landscaping.\n- The land is 80% greenery and 20% building. Previously it was the opposite.\n- The roof hosts the largest solar installation on a building.\n- The building temperature is maintained at a comfortable level by passive mechanisms most of the time.\n\n[![A view through the convex side of a curved glass window.

There we descended to a lower level where a gallery space had been set up showing photos and videos from behind the scenes of a project called [_Mirage_](https://mirage.place). There were even some samples of the cast glass made for the project.\n\n[![Glass awnings and windows are visible on three consecutive levels as viewed from the ground.

				"content_html": "<p>Our house has five steps to get down to the backyard. A few weeks ago, a board on the top step cracked on the edge. I added some blue tape to make it more visible until I got around to fixing it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/454e484af8.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/454e484af8.jpg\" alt=\"Front view of steps. There’s blue tape on a board on the top tread.\"></a></p>\n<p>Soon thereafter I started working on a plan to fix it. The simplest thing would be to replace the board but many other boards are also not in good shape, so a fresh set would be best, especially since I may be getting some painting work done and a fresh coat on this could be added to that. Once I decided to go with that I felt like I had to address the fact that the treads are held up by two stringers, and there really ought to be three. This was starting to feel like yak shaving but I hadn&rsquo;t taken on a project like this in a while and it was appealing to spend the time to do it right.</p>\n<p>So my plan was to remove the treads, measure out a new stringer to go in the middle, cut it out of a 2x12, attach it and then put a whole bunch of fresh boards, probably also adding risers. After talking to friends and looking at some videos it seemed like reasonable idea.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I got to it. First I removed the treads. I noticed that the bottom of one stringer had a crack and was about to come apart. I drove a couple of screws to reattach it. This was the <em>first new issue</em> I noticed. I also noticed that each stringer was resting differently, the concrete seems to go around one, but under the other. That was the <em>second new issue</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/3d73495b51.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/3d73495b51.jpg\" alt=\"A view of the steps after removing the treads. Two stringers are visible.\"></a></p>\n<p>After removing the treads I measured out the stringers and this is what those measurements were like. As you can see, there is not much consistency between the two, including the fact that the first step from the ground was not only wildly higher than the others, it is also well over the building code. These were the <em>third and fourth new issues</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cb7551a514.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cb7551a514.jpg\" alt=\"A page in a notebook with a rough sketch showing the geometry and measurements on each stringer. They differ significantly.\"></a></p>\n<p>Nevertheless I figured out measurements and marked it on the board but that didn&rsquo;t look right. I did it again. Something was still off. I looked at the stringers closely and noticed a <em>fifth new issue</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f3ce2bfd5d.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f3ce2bfd5d.jpg\" alt=\"A carpenter’s square placed against the riser of a stringer showing that is is not square and in fact has been deliberately cut off square.\"></a></p>\n<p>For whatever reason the builder had removed extra material from each corner of each stringer so the angles weren&rsquo;t square. That was the last straw. At that point I decided that there were too many issues with leaving the existing structure intact and that the more reasonable thing would be to just rebuild the steps from scratch.</p>\n<p>I put the treads back while moving the cracked board to the bottom tread so it was out of the way where it would cause any harm. I also cleaned it up a bit and applied wood glue for good measure. All of this is a temporary measure until these can be rebuilt either by me, or by someone I hire. Will report back after that!</p>\n",

There’s blue tape on a board on the top tread.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/454e484af8.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/454e484af8.jpg)\n\nSoon thereafter I started working on a plan to fix it. The simplest thing would be to replace the board but many other boards are also not in good shape, so a fresh set would be best, especially since I may be getting some painting work done and a fresh coat on this could be added to that. Once I decided to go with that I felt like I had to address the fact that the treads are held up by two stringers, and there really ought to be three. This was starting to feel like yak shaving but I hadn't taken on a project like this in a while and it was appealing to spend the time to do it right.\n\nSo my plan was to remove the treads, measure out a new stringer to go in the middle, cut it out of a 2x12, attach it and then put a whole bunch of fresh boards, probably also adding risers. After talking to friends and looking at some videos it seemed like reasonable idea.\n\nYesterday I got to it. First I removed the treads. I noticed that the bottom of one stringer had a crack and was about to come apart. I drove a couple of screws to reattach it. This was the _first new issue_ I noticed. I also noticed that each stringer was resting differently, the concrete seems to go around one, but under the other. That was the _second new issue_.\n\n[![A view of the steps after removing the treads. Two stringers are visible.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/3d73495b51.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/3d73495b51.jpg)\n\nAfter removing the treads I measured out the stringers and this is what those measurements were like. As you can see, there is not much consistency between the two, including the fact that the first step from the ground was not only wildly higher than the others, it is also well over the building code. These were the _third and fourth new issues_.\n\n[![A page in a notebook with a rough sketch showing the geometry and measurements on each stringer. They differ significantly.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cb7551a514.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/cb7551a514.jpg)\n\nNevertheless I figured out measurements and marked it on the board but that didn't look right. I did it again. Something was still off. I looked at the stringers closely and noticed a _fifth new issue_.\n\n[![A carpenter’s square placed against the riser of a stringer showing that is is not square and in fact has been deliberately cut off square.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f3ce2bfd5d.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2023/f3ce2bfd5d.jpg)\n\nFor whatever reason the builder had removed extra material from each corner of each stringer so the angles weren't square. That was the last straw. At that point I decided that there were too many issues with leaving the existing structure intact and that the more reasonable thing would be to just rebuild the steps from scratch.\n\nI put the treads back while moving the cracked board to the bottom tread so it was out of the way where it would cause any harm. I also cleaned it up a bit and applied wood glue for good measure. All of this is a temporary measure until these can be rebuilt either by me, or by someone I hire. Will report back after that!\n",

This same man asked for our names by turn and said it out loud as he looked upwards, to sound an echo.\n\nAfter walking around the inside, we made our way to the outside on the provided path. As we did so, the light of the setting sun made lovely patterns as it made its way in through the carved and perforated marble walls.\n\n[![Plaza on the backside of the Taj Mahal at sunset with partial views of a minor, the mosque and the Yamuna river.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/1c3dc1d11a.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/1c3dc1d11a.jpg)\n\n[![Main arch on the back of the Taj Mahal with inscriptions around it, and relief carvings on the inside.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/678af6d307.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/678af6d307.jpg)\n\n[![Jenni in front of the guest house adjacent to the Taj Mahal with warm sunset light falling on it.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/9d6696dc62.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/9d6696dc62.jpg)\n\n[![View of the main gate and gardens looking back from the plaza of the Taj Mahal with a large number of people visible on all the paths.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/63c0e2deb6.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/63c0e2deb6.jpg)\n\nEven a Tuesday afternoon brought a lot of visitors.\n\n[![Jenni in front of one of the minars of the Taj Mahal with warm sunset light falling on both.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/eec17412ed.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/eec17412ed.jpg)\n\n[![Looking up from the base of the plaza of the Taj Mahal with views of the inscriptions and stone inlay work on two of the side arches, with warm sunset light on all of it and a clear blue sky behind.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/837e9ae8cb.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/837e9ae8cb.jpg)\n\n[![Looking up from the gardens towards the Taj Mahal with the mosque in the distance, and the sky with a gradient of blue to yellow behind.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/976a6df7bf.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/976a6df7bf.jpg)\n\n[![Taj Mahal in the cool white light of dusk as seen from the main gate.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/173d05093c.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/173d05093c.jpg)\n\nAs we made our way back to the exit by the main gate, the Sun set completely and so the Taj appeared a cool white, which was very different from the vibrant yellow and orange it had been in the hours before. I’m pretty sure that previously I had only visited in mid-day so hadn’t seen this effect. Experiencing these changing colors on the Taj was my favorite thing about this visit, which was my third or fourth.\n\nMaybe someday I'll even see the famous full-moon-lit shade of Taj.\n\n---\n\nUpload images using [Mimi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696).\n",

This afforded lovely views, starting with the campground area, followed by more expansive views of the lake, with rocky islands spotting it all over.\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/5032c4373a.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/5032c4373a.jpg)\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/65b8eca4bb.jpg)\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/efbc041cdb.jpg)\n\nAfter about twenty minutes of hiking and stopping to admire views, we came to the farthest point on the loop and the trail turned away from the edge. The return path was through grassy fields. To start, on our right there was a short slope to a lower elevation of a large field. In the distance we could see to the end of the rock plateau, then a gap and another large rock or hill beyond that. \n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/fa9311ed5d.jpg)\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/f4b8a74404.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/f4b8a74404.jpg)\n\nA short while of hiking on the plateau, with some gentle ups and down slopes, got us back to the start of the loop. Not much to see except a dramatic sky above and grassy fields on either side with a small variety of wildflowers.\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/e7b050b515.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/e7b050b515.jpg)\n\nWe made our way back to the fork in the middle of the rock, descended the switchbacks, and soon found ourselves on the last stretch of the trail.\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/cb174978d9.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/cb174978d9.jpg)\n\nAt this point the sky was _very_ dramatic. It seemed like the thunderstorm was about to start, and we were glad to not be the highest objects in the vicinity anymore.\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/ff6f4bc1fd.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/ff6f4bc1fd.jpg)\n\n## Activity Stats\n\nDistance: 4.09 miles  \nElevation Gain: 835 ft  \nTime (including breaks): 2h 41m  \n",

Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/434d226695.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/434d226695.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did 🎉</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It&rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.</p>\n<p>In these pandemic days it&rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I&rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I&rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I&rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives.

The new picker has great features for browsing, searching, making multiple selections, etc. This is perfect for apps like Mimi where people can pick the photos they want to upload with minimum friction and with an experience that feels true to iOS. I&rsquo;m very conscious of privacy in apps, so it gives me great joy to note that with this new picker Mimi will no longer need to ask for Photos permission.</p>\n<p>I had planned to enhance the original photo selection screen with new features for better selection, but now I can utilize that time towards other features that folks have requested. Features that I think will be a lot more useful in the long term, like support for the share sheet, and drag and drop, that allows sending photos into Mimi from other apps. And I have more ideas that I hope to share after this initial set of work is complete.</p>\n<p>I can&rsquo;t wait to bring this new experience to you sometime after iOS 14 launches this Fall. I appreciate your support and comments.

About half a mile up is a \"difficulty fork\" 😂\n\n![Group at difficulty fork](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/41ab47c447.jpg)\n\nFor the first 2.5 to 3 miles the trail is like many others in the Gorge, comprising of switchbacks through the woods.\n\n![Tree in the forest](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/57ee4dfe13.jpg)\n\n![Mossy, dreamy forest](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/fd6f11f750.jpg)\n\n![Double trunks](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/2220be6561.jpg)\n\nHalfway to the top the trail emerged from the forest briefly for a sweeping vista of the river and the gorge.\n\n![Vista of river](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/d77e20366b.jpg)\n\nFor the last half mile going up, we were out of the trees and surrounded by wildflowers. It was here that the wind also picked up significantly. This final stretch afforded gorgeous view all the way, with our trail surrounded by steep slopes full of wildflowers.\n\n![Emerging into the clearance](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/01d37e049d.jpg)\n\n![Wildflowers, with Wind Mountain in the distance](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/7d2ee241f1.jpg)\n\n![Trail through the slope of wildflowers](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/ab2824ee88.jpg)\n\n![Wildflower photography on the edge](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/4fd95d3143.jpg)\n\nThe views at the summit were incredible. Some fast moving clouds engulfed us soon after we arrived. That was quite a show before it cleared up in a few minutes. It was time to put on another layer. We sat there and enjoyed the views as we had lunch comprising of tasty sandwiches that Jenni had made, and some chips.\n\n![Fast moving clouds at the summit](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/7bf6619913.gif)\n\n![Jenni coming up the last switchback](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/865a9e2f85.jpg)\n\n![Lunch at the top](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/631daf21e2.jpg)\n\nAs we started back down, my IT band was hurting on the outer side of each of my knees. I was annoyed at myself for not having taken the time to go on hikes and do regular stretches since the [Coyote Wall hike](https://samgrover.com/2019/04/30/hiking-at-coyote.html) from over a month ago. Every downward step was painful. Soon Jenni reminded me of the cross-leg stretches and those helped. Those and the hiking poles were incredibly helpful in making the descent.\n\n![Stretches on the trail. Photo by Jenni.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/fc8ebfc65d.jpg)\n\n![Heading back down](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/90ddff0bac.jpg)\n\nHeading back down we reentered the forest, and it sheltered us from the sun and wind for the rest of the way.\n\n![Staggered view of the group](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2019/a1ab443d81.jpg)\n\nAll in all this was a great hike with friends, and brought tremendous satisfaction on a personal level. It is entirely possible that someday my back may go bad again, but I'm grateful that I can do this today, and motivated to keep it this way. I'm also grateful for Jenni who has been supportive and encouraging all along the way ❤️\n\n### Activity stats:\nDistance: 7 miles (11.27 km)  \nElevation Gain: 2800 ft (853m)  \nAscent/Descent: 800 ft/mile (75.76 m/km)  \nTime (including breaks): 5h 30m  \n",

I've never hiked through a place devastated by fire before, so it was a new an interesting experience from that regard.\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/977f3a474e.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2aea63ac05.jpg)\n\nSome areas on the trail were a bit muddy with puddles but mostly it was fine.\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/daffebc942.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/3263620192.jpg)\n\nViews were great as always.\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/e136270465.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/2738ab5688.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/39e0a35afe.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/f72751ca3b.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/23f58fb814.jpg)\n\n![](http://samgrover.micro.blog/uploads/2019/a8c28eb5ae.jpg)\n\n### Activity stats:\nDistance: 4.9 miles  \nElevation Gain: 1484 ft  \nTime (including breaks): 3h 5m  \n",

The highlight was the visit to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Also, after three-and-a-half years at Intel, I left to join Small Society to make cool iOS apps. I started at Small Society on 22nd March.</li>\n\t<li>June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel.</li>\n\t<li>July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback.  We had to <a href=\"http://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/\">let Yoshi go</a>.</li>\n\t<li>August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend.</li>\n\t<li>September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time. We all had a great time there. I also visited family in Chicago for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIt was another amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one.\n\nAnd lastly, here’s more about the number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34_%28number%29\">34</a>.\n",

It is located across the road from the airport in McMinnville. There are two museum buildings which house the aviation and space museums and a third building has an IMAX theater. Some aircraft are displayed in spaces along the buildings too. We only visited the aviation museum, choosing to return to the space museum on another day, perhaps after they install one of the retiring space shuttles, which they plan to do.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>It is clear upon looking at the aviation museum and the time spent inside it that the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hercules<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is their star attraction. It takes up most of the space and even though there are about a hundred other aircrafts spanning the hundred year history of powered flight, they all appear negligible next to it. The critics of this magnificent aircraft, the largest of its time, called it the “Spruce Goose”. Liz and I were disappointed that this name, which was despised by Hughes, was the one used prominently by the museum. Their website address uses it; they sport it on gift store items; and they even have a winery that makes wine branded the same.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Even in their relative smallness, the other aircrafts on display offer a great collection of beautiful airplanes, helicopters, balloon-basket, a Wright 1903 Flyer replica and even a model skeleton of the wing-like device sketched by Leonardo DaVinci. There were some charming touches to the museum. Sitting next to a WW2 bomber was an old man who had flown one of those for thirty missions over France and Germany when he was eighteen. Alongside some planes were accurate models. One depicted intricately the machine gun wing assembly on a WW2 fighter. Next to the Hercules was a model of it used in the Scorsese film and donated to the museum.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>On our way back, we checked out a few wineries, tasted the wines at a couple of them and bought some at one in Dundee. I haven’t been a fan of wine most of my life, having sided with beer whenever presented a choice, but in recent times I have started to experiment. Now, having had some really delicious ones, I’m starting to become a fan to the extent that I know a bit about what I like and what I don&rsquo;t like. My wine vocabulary remains minimal and will probably stay that way unless my interest in it skyrockets.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>We drove back to Portland through a different, but similarly scenic route. To top off the lovely Sunday, which was filled with expected and unexpected pleasures, that night we saw Terry Jones’ <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik the Viking<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.

We only visited the aviation museum, choosing to return to the space museum on another day, perhaps after they install one of the retiring space shuttles, which they plan to do.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3920922773\" title=\"View 'Planes and Hercules' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3445/3920922773_b731541df5.jpg\" alt=\"Planes and Hercules\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></div>\n\nIt is clear upon looking at the aviation museum and the time spent inside it that the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-4_Hercules\">Hercules</a> is their star attraction. It takes up most of the space and even though there are about a hundred other aircrafts spanning the hundred year history of powered flight, they all appear negligible next to it. The critics of this magnificent aircraft, the largest of its time, called it the “Spruce Goose”. Liz and I were disappointed that this name, which was despised by Hughes, was the one used prominently by the museum. Their website address uses it; they sport it on gift store items; and they even have a winery that makes wine branded the same.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3918838670\" title=\"View 'Retro flying' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2621/3918838670_87b241f19e.jpg\" alt=\"Retro flying\" border=\"0\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a></div>\n\nEven in their relative smallness, the other aircrafts on display offer a great collection of beautiful airplanes, helicopters, balloon-basket, a Wright 1903 Flyer replica and even a model skeleton of the wing-like device sketched by Leonardo DaVinci. There were some charming touches to the museum. Sitting next to a WW2 bomber was an old man who had flown one of those for thirty missions over France and Germany when he was eighteen. Alongside some planes were accurate models. One depicted intricately the machine gun wing assembly on a WW2 fighter. Next to the Hercules was a model of it used in the Scorsese film and donated to the museum.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3918842350\" title=\"View 'Hughes and the professor' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3531/3918842350_cf19d7463e.jpg\" alt=\"Hughes and the professor\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a></div>\n\nOn our way back, we checked out a few wineries, tasted the wines at a couple of them and bought some at one in Dundee. I haven’t been a fan of wine most of my life, having sided with beer whenever presented a choice, but in recent times I have started to experiment. Now, having had some really delicious ones, I’m starting to become a fan to the extent that I know a bit about what I like and what I don't like. My wine vocabulary remains minimal and will probably stay that way unless my interest in it skyrockets.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3918060129\" title=\"View 'Tasting some wine' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3455/3918060129_77cf708e01.jpg\" alt=\"Tasting some wine\" border=\"0\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" /></a></div>\n\nWe drove back to Portland through a different, but similarly scenic route. To top off the lovely Sunday, which was filled with expected and unexpected pleasures, that night we saw Terry Jones’ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Erik%20the%20Viking&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;index=dvd&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\">Erik the Viking</a>. It featured a different kind of flying boat and was quite hilarious.\n",

I typically haven't thought in terms of color unless it felt quite essential, and have preferred B&amp;W film for the most part.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/1429078633\" title=\"View 'Michael rolls a cigarette' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1096/1429078633_aaf15ea785.jpg\" alt=\"Michael rolls a cigarette\" border=\"0\" width=\"319\" height=\"500\" /></a></div>\n\nThe gist of the matter is that this is a really good exercise. In the end, like Mike says,\n\n<blockquote>Because make no mistake, photographing the way I suggested in the previous post is the photographic equivalent of being a top athlete: it takes dedication and coordination and talent and time and sacrifice and lots of training.</blockquote>\n\nThis gels with what Malcolm Gladwell has written in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316036692?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0316036692\">Outliers</a> and with my own experience. What matters most is that you put a lot of time and effort into it. The constraints Mike suggests help to make the exercise even more focused, pun unintended. It's definitely not the only exercise out there but I sincerely believe that if you were to do this, it would greatly benefit your photographic eye. I can surely feel it and perhaps my photography shows it.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/44124379481@N01/3514997446\" title=\"View 'Liz at Monument Valley' on Flickr.com\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3326/3514997446_a58366eb95.jpg\" alt=\"Liz at Monument Valley\" border=\"0\" width=\"500\" height=\"307\" /></a></div>\n\nWhen I started using my Bessa, I dumped my DSLR and haven't missed it since. Having said that, I think I'm getting weary of having a film based workflow as my primary one. I'm still hoping that a nice digital rangefinder will come along or that I will find it reasonable to invest in a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IM3W0E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001IM3W0E\">Leica M8</a>. Until then I may try the new <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3429E?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001W3429E\">Sigma DP2</a>. It looks quite promising. I'll keep an eye out for the news and reviews and look at photos from it for a couple of months before deciding.\n",

Later that month, I traveled to Porto, Portugal to attend a conference. Lovely little city. It was my first time in Europe.</li>\n\t<li>August - Liz and I had our <a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/\">Portland wedding</a>. Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there. I traveled to San Francisco to showcase my work.</li>\n\t<li>September - I hacked together <a href=\"http://github.com/samgrover/ff2tweet/tree/master\">ff2tweet</a>. Hope to refine it further in the future.</li>\n</ul>\nIt was a wonderful year and I'm looking forward to the next one.\n\nAnd lastly, here's more about the number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32_(number)\">32</a>.\n",

The hotel (Hotel Melia Gaia Porto) was in the area south of the Douro river called Vila Nova De Gaia. That evening I got food at a nearby place and explored about a mile around the hotel, partly in search of a wall adapter for my laptop power cord.

Each day, I would attend sessions until about 6pm and then head out to explore the city. On Saturday I took a leisurely photowalk towards the city center. As I got closer to the river, historic buildings appeared and this time I was reminded of Bombay, which has a heavy Portugese influence. The extent of that influence was more than I realized. I rediscovered words that I thought were of Indian origin, only to find that they were in fact Portugese. In Bombay, the word for bread is &lsquo;pao&rsquo; and the word for potato is &lsquo;batata&rsquo;. Both of those are Portugese words.

				"content_text": "<p align=\"justify\">I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India. It said, \" ... All ok in Mumbai. You may not be able to contact them as lines jammed ...\". He was referring to my sister and her family. I didn't know what to make of this. I thought that perhaps the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5163288.stm\" title=\"Hindu hardliners riot in Mumbai\">Sunday incident</a> had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm\" title=\"Scores dead in Mumbai train bombs\">bomb blasts</a>. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (<a href=\"http://lastingnews.com/maps/mumbai_terror.php\" title=\"Mumbai attacks\">Mapped locations</a>). For more info and details from the blogosphere, see <a href=\"http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/terrorists-blow-up-bombay-trains\" title=\"Terrorists blow up Bombay trains\">Ultrabrown</a>,  <a href=\"http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2006/07/blasts-in-bombay.html\" title=\"Blasts in Bombay\">Vantage Point</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003563.html\" title=\"Bombay's rush hour rocked by blasts\">Sepia Mutiny</a>, <a href=\"http://mumbaihelp.blogspot.com/\" title=\"Mumbai Help\">MumbaiHelp</a>, and <a href=\"http://mumbai.metblogs.com/\" title=\"Metroblogging Mumbai\">Metroblogging Mumbai</a>. Unfortunately, this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Mumbai_bombings\" title=\"1993 Mumbai bombings\">isn't the first time</a> this beloved city has been a target.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just the other day, in conversation with friends, I was reminiscing my experiences with riding the trains in Bombay. I grew up there through most of the nineties, mid-teens to early twenties. Rush hour travel is the kind of thing you'd remember fondly only if you were nostalgic. The train cars are sometimes packed so tight, one could travel upright without either foot on the floor. 4.5 million people commute on the trains everyday. With that in mind, the horror of these events is inescapable. Emotions will run high, we'll all mourn, but the people of Mumbai will not be terrorized.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1993, in the days after the thirteen serial bomb blasts in two hours, there were billboards proclaiming that the city got back on it's feet within 24 hours. In memory of those who died, I hope that spirit prevails, that the aftermath is peaceful, and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>\n",

But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it's great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.</p>\n<p>I started to use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Google Spreadsheets<!-- raw HTML omitted --> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that's ok since it's only a limited test. It can import and export <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XLS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSV<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven't tried that yet. I'm looking forward to more such applications. I'm guessing that I'll use some of them while others I won't, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.</p>\n<p>And now for the idle speculation part, which kinda builds on what I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->first read<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a long time ago. This new product makes me wonder that with the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->known<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and unknown components below their web applications, Google probably has a development platform for hosting applications on their infrastructure. I wonder if they would make it available to developers too. Let's call it the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->e<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nvironment for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->ogle <!-- raw HTML omitted -->D<!-- raw HTML omitted -->evelopers, or eGoD ;-).

				"content_text": "I don&#039;t have any major need for spreadsheets, so I&#039;m definitely not inclined to buy some software for it. But there are a few little things for which I could use one and that is why it&#039;s great to see a free web application from Google that provides it.\n\nI started to use <a href=\"http://spreadsheets.google.com/\" title=\"Google Spreadsheets\">Google Spreadsheets</a> yesterday and found it very convenient and simple to use. It offers some basic functionality for now but that&#039;s ok since it&#039;s only a limited test. It can import and export <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLS\" title=\"Microsoft Excel\">XLS</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values\" title=\"Comma Separated Values\">CSV</a> files at the moment, so I converted my few files from a simple text format into CSV and they were smoothly imported. The application looks quite slick. This is the first application from Google that looks a lot like a desktop application. It has menus near the top with similar items as a standard desktop application. There are buttons for the usual suspects; Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo and Redo. It has collaborative features to let multiple users edit the same file and provides a chat interface too. I haven&#039;t tried that yet. I&#039;m looking forward to more such applications. I&#039;m guessing that I&#039;ll use some of them while others I won&#039;t, picking and choosing depending on usage, usability and desktop alternative availability.\n\nAnd now for the idle speculation part, which kinda builds on what I <a href=\"http://www.kottke.org/04/04/google-operating-system\" title=\"GooOS, the Google Operating System\">first read</a> a long time ago. This new product makes me wonder that with the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/\" title=\"Google Code - Google&#039;s Developer Network\">known</a> and unknown components below their web applications, Google probably has a development platform for hosting applications on their infrastructure.

Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.\n<ul>\n<li>It&#039;s a little bizzare to see the lens through the viewfinder, but I got over that pretty soon.</li>\n<li>It is well known that rangefinders are quiet because they don&#039;t have a moving mirror. Even so, I was surprised by the quietness of the mechanism.</li>\n<li>The shutter priority operation threw me off for a while because I&#039;m used to shooting with aperture priority. It makes me think in terms of time, while I&#039;m used to thinking in terms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field\" title=\"Depth of field\">depth of field</a>, or rather not thinking much in terms of either by setting the parameters once and not messing with it unless really needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/151705515/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/151705515_58bd3e843d_m.jpg\" alt=\"In the tree&#039;s shadow\" align=\"left\" height=\"160\" width=\"240\" /></a>The hardest thing to do was the focusing. The viewfinder has a very small area to check the focus accurately, and its not something I could manage to do quickly. I found myself pre-focusing most of the time by reading the distance marking on the lens. So, I used the viewfinder only for framing, just before taking the picture. I like the speed of such operation, but have been reluctant to do pre-focusing before now. This camera kinda forced it upon me and I&#039;ll try to do it more often. I think it is a good skill to have for street photography, especially when using a manual focus mechanism. There is usually no time to focus.\n\nIt&#039;s been <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/77921985/\" title=\"Of course it&#039;s raining, d&#039;uh!\">raining again</a> for the last week, so I haven&#039;t had any chance to shoot more with this camera.

It is based on Anthony Burgess' book of the same name. It is one of my favorite movies and I had never seen it in a theater. So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">There are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat\">Nadsat</a>, which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">See it.

Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">What motivated me to read this book was the concept of the \"<a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php\">Database of Intentions</a>\". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in \"<a title=\"As We May Think\" href=\"http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml\">As We May Think</a>\", which is cited in the book. A meta-Memex.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">A good portion of the book, however, is devoted to the history of search technology and industry. That is quite interesting in and of itself as I like to read about such things. There are several anecdotes about the people and companies that played a part in these nascent times. I found it to be too detailed in some places, but the book is written such that one could easily skip those parts if one finds them too dull. I didn't.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The epilogue highlights that we remember people from history because they became immortal through records. In the future, everyone will be immortal because everything will be recorded. This blog is being recorded. All of it will add to the noise and one will have to shout or be referenced a lot to be seen clearly. Will you shout? What will you say? I think you should write a book while they are still in vogue ;-)</p>\n",

I like working with both. The B&amp;W shot is film and the colored one is digital. Interestingly, both were very quick shots, about ten seconds from identifying to clicking. Both were taken on a street, first one in Portland and the second one in Seattle. I like taking pictures on the street and that is where I focus my efforts, even though these photos don't present the flavor of street photography that I like.

The book is about the author's efforts to understand the human brain's mechanism for intelligence and to apply it to machines. He presents a model of intelligence called the memory-prediction framework.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">This was perhaps the first time I had read a somewhat detailed analysis of the possible mechanism that drives human intelligence. Some concepts that I found especially interesting were that of invariant and hierarchical memory. Also, the idea that the brain predicts all actions before they are executed was fascinating. If the subject interests you, I highly recommend it. It is quite readable.</p>\n",

Interesting items include <i>\"What most people don’t know is that Apple, with the assistance of Intel, a few years ago ported all its software to run on Intel’s Pentium processors.\"</i>\n<br /><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040520.html\">Divide and Conquer: Why Apple Has an iPod Division</a>\n",
