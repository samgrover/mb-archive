				"content_html": "<p>Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Mimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.</p>\n<p>The other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images and are shown inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list. A badge is used to indicate one type or another. There are other minor UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. Mimi uploads shows a count of images. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so. The screenshots below show the new interface.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/39c018e6a5.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/39c018e6a5.png\" alt=\"Screenshots showing interface changes described above.\"></a></p>\n<p>Exporting still works the same way with a right swipe.

				"content_text": "Recent Uploads used to show only the uploads you make from Mimi Uploader. With the new update it will also show uploads made to your Micro.blog account from anywhere else.\n\nMimi is primarily a batch uploader and that is my favorite way of using it. I like to make blog posts that have a set of photos, and making that process smoother was the motivation to create Mimi in the first place. As such, each batch of photos shows up in Recent Uploads as a set.\n\nThe other uploads to a Micro.blog account are only accessible as individual images and are shown inline with the sets of Mimi uploads in the same reverse chronological list. A badge is used to indicate one type or another. There are other minor UI differences between the two types in the list, e.g. Mimi uploads shows a count of images. On the top right is a filter button that lets you filter for one type or another, if you choose to do so. The screenshots below show the new interface.\n\n[![Screenshots showing interface changes described above.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/39c018e6a5.png)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2022/39c018e6a5.png)\n\nExporting still works the same way with a right swipe.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now. Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor.

				"content_text": "[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/6d0de790b1.jpg)\n\nI've been intrigued by the idea of a video doorbell for some time now. Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn't even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.\n\nAt the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn't something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn't be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.\n\nThankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.\n\nNow, as I mentioned, we didn't have a doorbell, so we didn't even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It's a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn't need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn't using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.\n\n[![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/434d226695.jpg)](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/1406/2020/434d226695.jpg)\n\nAt this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up.

So far I&rsquo;ve been using it as a plain old journal, where you write what&rsquo;s on your mind. Recently, I decided that I wanted to get my digital history into it as well. One of the first things that came to mind was my <a href=\"https://foursquare.com\">Foursquare/Swarm</a> checkin history which goes back to 2009. I decided to start there.</p>\n<p>I exported all my data and wrote a script in Python to extract what I needed from it to make journal entries. The two relevant files were <code>checkins.json</code> and <code>photos.json</code>. You can <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6\">get my script on Github by selecting here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to use it, or dig into it. It should also appear embedded at the end of this post. First the script pre-processes the data to get all the photos attached to checkins. Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn&rsquo;t include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.</p>\n<p>It makes calls to the <a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com/docs\">Foursquare API</a> to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI\">command line utility</a>. I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they&rsquo;d all been imported. I could&rsquo;ve automated that but I wasn&rsquo;t keen on spending the time on that.</p>\n<p>Day One does allow one to link it to <a href=\"https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one\">IFTTT</a> so that all <em>new</em> checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I&rsquo;ve not been happy with that integration. Now that I&rsquo;m familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;d love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I&rsquo;m keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",

Then it goes over the checkin history to extract most of what I want, but since the exported data doesn't include venue coordinates, it has to do a little more.\n\nIt makes calls to the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs) to fetch the venue coordinates for each checkin. Then it puts everything together and makes the actual entry using Day One's [command line utility](http://dayoneapp.com/support/CLI). I had several thousand entries but the free plan for the API has a daily limit of 500 calls, so I manually ran it a few times over the course of a couple of weeks until they'd all been imported. I could've automated that but I wasn't keen on spending the time on that.\n\nDay One does allow one to link it to [IFTTT](https://help.dayoneapp.com/tips-and-tutorials/using-ifttt-with-day-one) so that all _new_ checkins get logged automatically, and I enabled that a while back, but I've not been happy with that integration. Now that I'm familiar with the flow of data, I plan to create new entries every couple of months or so, perhaps with a new script that works entirely with the API.\n\nI'd love to hear if you have automated any journaling as I'm keen to explore other ways of doing so myself.\n\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/26939e0b68a26b7fe03a7a4bd37bdcf6.js\"></script>\n",

The highlight was the visit to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Also, after three-and-a-half years at Intel, I left to join Small Society to make cool iOS apps. I started at Small Society on 22nd March.</li>\n\t<li>June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel.</li>\n\t<li>July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback.  We had to <a href=\"http://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/\">let Yoshi go</a>.</li>\n\t<li>August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend.</li>\n\t<li>September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time. We all had a great time there. I also visited family in Chicago for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIt was another amazing year and I’m looking forward to the next one.\n\nAnd lastly, here’s more about the number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34_%28number%29\">34</a>.\n",

In India, we had our New Delhi wedding. In Nepal we visited Liz's home and friends in the Himalayas and in Bali we had our honeymoon.

Been enjoying glorious Blu-Ray and some cool games since then.</li>\n\t<li>February - Started working on Avatari. My first Mac application in Cocoa. Had my first car accident. It was minor.</li>\n\t<li>April - Demoed and released <a href=\"http://samgrover.com/software/\">Avatari</a> at Demolicious. Liz and I went road-tripping thru the southwest. Visited Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, Monument Valley and Grand Canyon. Some of the most amazing landscapes I've ever seen.

No more visa hassles!</li>\n\t<li>August - Liz and I traveled to Kaua'i where we had a great time celebrating our first anniversary.

When I would do that it would annoy me that I had to go to each individual location where I had uploaded my avatar for a brief replacement.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nI made Avatari to solve this problem. It currently supports multiple accounts on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/\">FriendFeed</a>. When I came up with this idea, I found that Twitter already had an API for uploading an avatar but FriendFeed didn't. I requested the folks at FriendFeed to create an API for me, and to my pleasant surprise, they had one ready in twenty days. Thanks guys! I hope to add more services in the future.\n\nMy other motivation for making Avatari is to teach myself Cocoa programming. I had hoped to make something useful while familiarizing myself with Cocoa. It's working great and I'm hoping to advance my knowledge of Cocoa software development with continued effort.\n\nLast week I presented Avatari to the folks at <a href=\"http://cocoaheads.org/us/PortlandOregon/index.html\">Portland CocoaHeads</a> and tonight I presented it at <a href=\"http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/1908530/\">Demolicious</a>.

The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>\n\t<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>\n\t<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>\n\t<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>\n\t<li>July - Liz and I made a <a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/\">trip to Maine</a> to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them.

It was my first time in Europe.</li>\n\t<li>August - Liz and I had our <a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/\">Portland wedding</a>. Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there.

They go quite well together.\n<div id=\"__ss_475989\" style=\"width:425px;text-align:left;\"><a href=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=08lizkimmerly-1213902037094975-9\">http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=08lizkimmerly-1213902037094975-9</a>\n<div style=\"font-size:11px;font-family:tahoma,arial;height:26px;padding-top:2px;\"><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/?src=embed\"><img style=\"border:0 none;margin-bottom:-5px;\" src=\"http://static.slideshare.net/swf/logo_embd.png\" alt=\"SlideShare\" /></a> | <a title=\"View Lizkimmerly on SlideShare\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/igniteportland/lizkimmerly?src=embed\">View</a> | <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/upload?src=embed\">Upload your own</a></div>\n</div>\n[youtube=[www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBLt3DO5Bis&w=425&h=344])\n\nAnd lastly for now, Liz and I decided to start a blog together to document our adventures. I kicked it off tonight with a basic theme and a first post about <a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/contact/\">how we met</a>.

				"content_html": "<p>It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, &ldquo;Hold it in your hands to see how it feels&rdquo;. One year has gone by with me using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the Bessa<!-- raw HTML omitted --> exclusively, and I love it.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>I bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CameraQuest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->early experience with a rangefinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canonet QL17 G-III<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame.

				"content_text": "It was heavier than I expected. I had ignored my cardinal law in purchasing a camera, \"Hold it in your hands to see how it feels\". One year has gone by with me using <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/357893935/\">the Bessa</a> exclusively, and I love it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/420818937/\" title=\"Artist by samgrover, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/420818937_3eb85528cf_m.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\" height=\"145\" width=\"240\" /></a>\n\nI bought it along with a 50mm Nokton f/1.5 lens and an adapter. The camera has an M mount, whereas the lens is a screw mount, so I needed an adapter. My plan was that if I liked this enough I could get an M mount Leica lens in the future and it would fit just fine with the camera. I still plan on doing that. Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <a href=\"http://cameraquest.com/voigtr2ar3a.htm\">CameraQuest</a>, a website that I haven't visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/525781647/\" title=\"Awaiting summer by samgrover, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1066/525781647_5b7580102c_m.jpg\" alt=\"Awaiting summer\" height=\"145\" width=\"240\" /></a>\n\nMy <a href=\"http://samgrover.com/2006/05/early-experience-with-a-rangef.php\">early experience with a rangefinder</a> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/tags/canonetql17giii/show/\" class=\"Plain\">Canonet QL17 G-III</a> from my friend <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/old_sarge/\">Doug</a>. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I'm not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don't have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes \"click\". The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.<br /><br />Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/1429955514/\" title=\"Swinging by samgrover, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1429955514_2555d1be68_m.jpg\" alt=\"Swinging\" height=\"240\" width=\"154\" /></a>\n\nOver the last year I've put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/\">my Flickr photostream</a>, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007.

				"content_text": "<p align=\"justify\">I was on my short commute today when I got a text message from my father in India. It said, \" ... All ok in Mumbai. You may not be able to contact them as lines jammed ...\". He was referring to my sister and her family. I didn't know what to make of this. I thought that perhaps the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5163288.stm\" title=\"Hindu hardliners riot in Mumbai\">Sunday incident</a> had flared up. I hadn't read the news this morning, so I called him and he told me about the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5169332.stm\" title=\"Scores dead in Mumbai train bombs\">bomb blasts</a>. Seven bombs went off on board various trains of the western lines within one hour (<a href=\"http://lastingnews.com/maps/mumbai_terror.php\" title=\"Mumbai attacks\">Mapped locations</a>). For more info and details from the blogosphere, see <a href=\"http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/terrorists-blow-up-bombay-trains\" title=\"Terrorists blow up Bombay trains\">Ultrabrown</a>,  <a href=\"http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2006/07/blasts-in-bombay.html\" title=\"Blasts in Bombay\">Vantage Point</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003563.html\" title=\"Bombay's rush hour rocked by blasts\">Sepia Mutiny</a>, <a href=\"http://mumbaihelp.blogspot.com/\" title=\"Mumbai Help\">MumbaiHelp</a>, and <a href=\"http://mumbai.metblogs.com/\" title=\"Metroblogging Mumbai\">Metroblogging Mumbai</a>. Unfortunately, this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Mumbai_bombings\" title=\"1993 Mumbai bombings\">isn't the first time</a> this beloved city has been a target.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just the other day, in conversation with friends, I was reminiscing my experiences with riding the trains in Bombay. I grew up there through most of the nineties, mid-teens to early twenties. Rush hour travel is the kind of thing you'd remember fondly only if you were nostalgic. The train cars are sometimes packed so tight, one could travel upright without either foot on the floor. 4.5 million people commute on the trains everyday. With that in mind, the horror of these events is inescapable. Emotions will run high, we'll all mourn, but the people of Mumbai will not be terrorized.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1993, in the days after the thirteen serial bomb blasts in two hours, there were billboards proclaiming that the city got back on it's feet within 24 hours. In memory of those who died, I hope that spirit prevails, that the aftermath is peaceful, and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>\n",

Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.\n<ul>\n<li>It&#039;s a little bizzare to see the lens through the viewfinder, but I got over that pretty soon.</li>\n<li>It is well known that rangefinders are quiet because they don&#039;t have a moving mirror. Even so, I was surprised by the quietness of the mechanism.</li>\n<li>The shutter priority operation threw me off for a while because I&#039;m used to shooting with aperture priority. It makes me think in terms of time, while I&#039;m used to thinking in terms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field\" title=\"Depth of field\">depth of field</a>, or rather not thinking much in terms of either by setting the parameters once and not messing with it unless really needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/151705515/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/151705515_58bd3e843d_m.jpg\" alt=\"In the tree&#039;s shadow\" align=\"left\" height=\"160\" width=\"240\" /></a>The hardest thing to do was the focusing. The viewfinder has a very small area to check the focus accurately, and its not something I could manage to do quickly. I found myself pre-focusing most of the time by reading the distance marking on the lens. So, I used the viewfinder only for framing, just before taking the picture. I like the speed of such operation, but have been reluctant to do pre-focusing before now. This camera kinda forced it upon me and I&#039;ll try to do it more often. I think it is a good skill to have for street photography, especially when using a manual focus mechanism. There is usually no time to focus.\n\nIt&#039;s been <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/77921985/\" title=\"Of course it&#039;s raining, d&#039;uh!\">raining again</a> for the last week, so I haven&#039;t had any chance to shoot more with this camera.

The bass sounds much better. They are more prone to slip out when used that way, but if you're not moving too much (just sitting, walking) they will be alright.

It is based on Anthony Burgess' book of the same name. It is one of my favorite movies and I had never seen it in a theater. So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">There are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat\">Nadsat</a>, which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">See it. Again.</p>\n",

Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">What motivated me to read this book was the concept of the \"<a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php\">Database of Intentions</a>\". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in \"<a title=\"As We May Think\" href=\"http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml\">As We May Think</a>\", which is cited in the book. A meta-Memex.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">A good portion of the book, however, is devoted to the history of search technology and industry. That is quite interesting in and of itself as I like to read about such things. There are several anecdotes about the people and companies that played a part in these nascent times. I found it to be too detailed in some places, but the book is written such that one could easily skip those parts if one finds them too dull. I didn't.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The epilogue highlights that we remember people from history because they became immortal through records. In the future, everyone will be immortal because everything will be recorded. This blog is being recorded. All of it will add to the noise and one will have to shout or be referenced a lot to be seen clearly. Will you shout? What will you say? I think you should write a book while they are still in vogue ;-)</p>\n",

The book is about the author's efforts to understand the human brain's mechanism for intelligence and to apply it to machines. He presents a model of intelligence called the memory-prediction framework.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">This was perhaps the first time I had read a somewhat detailed analysis of the possible mechanism that drives human intelligence. Some concepts that I found especially interesting were that of invariant and hierarchical memory. Also, the idea that the brain predicts all actions before they are executed was fascinating.
