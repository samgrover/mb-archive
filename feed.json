This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/6981b709e9.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/6981b709e9.jpg\" alt=\"View of conference area from back and above. A large screen with the Apple logo is visible in the distance. There a number of rows of chairs in between. Tall steel grey pillars dominate the vertical space.\"></a></p>\n<p>I arrived about an hour before the keynote. After going through the security check, I made my way to Caff√© Macs where the event was set up. There was food and beverages. I picked up some coffee, some overnight oats with blueberry compote, and a savory pastry. Once I was done with that I found spot amongst some Apple engineers just in time for the keynote to start.</p>\n<p>After the keynote was lunchtime. I walked round for a bit looking at all the food options before settling on the grilled chicken with salad. I took this over to the inner meadow where there were a number of tables set up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b2c188c364.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b2c188c364.jpg\" alt=\"A number of tables are set up in rows in a meadow with people seated at them. Rainbow arches are visible in the distance. A cloudy hazy sky above.\"></a></p>\n<p>I sat down randomly and started to eat and chat with others. Turned out I was sitting right next to an industrial designer on the Vision Pro, so the conversation was mostly about that.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/10e7b90534.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/10e7b90534.jpg\" alt=\"Curved glass windows separate the outside from the inside. People walking around and seated on tables outside. Everything is reflected in glassy ceilings and awnings.\"></a></p>\n<p>Then it was time for the Platforms State of the Union. At first I went to the outside area by the main stage and sat on the fabric lounge chairs, but that was bothering my back so I came back inside to sit on a sturdier chair.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg\" alt=\"A number of people in blue T-shirts with WWDC23 written on their backs are watching a screen with a video playing.\"></a></p>\n<p>As I watched the video, I also noticed the space, how it was full of sunlight, large indoor trees, and expansive and seamlessly transitioning from inside to outside. And every bit of it was curved. This was certainly a unique space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/154449a030.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/154449a030.jpg\" alt=\"Curved ceilings and windows let in sunlight high above the hall.

Curved glass wall from ground to ceiling in the left and an indoor terrace in the right.\"></a></p>\n<p>Once that video was done, it was time for other social events. I had previously signed up for walking tours of the inner meadow and of the ring building, but that system seemed to have not worked too well for Apple as they were now just organizing all that on a first come first served basis. I got in line for the inner meadow tour.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg\" alt=\"A young man is sitting at a table outdoors under a shade structure.

Our first stop was by some fruit trees where a docent talked about all the fruit they grow and how it is all set up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg\" alt=\"A curved concave building with large glass windows is visible in the distance. Fruit trees are in the foreground.\"></a></p>\n<p>The second stop was by a shallow pond. In the center of the pond was a round plate that goes up and down. This creates a gentle wave that is imperceptible unless one is looking closely, but makes a definite wave crashing sound as it reached the edge of the pond. that was pretty cool.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg\" alt=\"A large round pond with a couple of ducks near the center. Behind it is a small hill with trees. The top of a curved building is behind that. Over it is a cloudy sky.\"></a></p>\n<p>The third and final stop was by the rainbow arches where a different docent talked about how it came to be as originally a temporary sculpture that was later made permanent. Then we made our way back on the same path.</p>\n<p>Right after that I got in line for the building tour. This was very popular and there was a lot of management going on to get people into small batches and move them along as tour guides returned from their previous tour and started a new one. At this point it definitely felt like I was in line for a theme park ride.</p>\n<p>The ring tour took us upstairs to the third level from one side of Caff√© Macs. Then to the inner side of the building, across the terrace overlooking the main event area and back down.</p>\n<p>At one point a docent talked about the structure of the building. Some interesting facts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Outer circumference is one mile. Inner circumference is 0.75 mile.</li>\n<li>There&rsquo;s a four feet quake zone all around the outside, so the whole building is capable of moving significantly in case of an earthquake.</li>\n<li>The two massive doors are the largest ever of their kind. And apparently super quiet when opening/closing.</li>\n<li>A lot of the dirt from digging up the foundation is piled up and forms the landscaping.</li>\n<li>The land is 80% greenery and 20% building. Previously it was the opposite.</li>\n<li>The roof hosts the largest solar installation on a building.</li>\n<li>The building temperature is maintained at a comfortable level by passive mechanisms most of the time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/cc2fc5b487.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/cc2fc5b487.jpg\" alt=\"A view through the convex side of a curved glass window.

There are a number of chairs, some people, a few style pillars and trees.\"></a></p>\n<p>From there we walked over to an area by the campus transit center. There we descended to a lower level where a gallery space had been set up showing photos and videos from behind the scenes of a project called <a href=\"https://mirage.place\"><em>Mirage</em></a>. There were even some samples of the cast glass made for the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/680384854f.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/680384854f.jpg\" alt=\"Glass awnings and windows are visible on three consecutive levels as viewed from the ground.

While it is definitely a crowning achievement for the winners, it is always fun and inspiring to see <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/\">all the apps that make it to the finals</a>, and this year was no exception. There was a lot of excitement and joy in the design awards.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b1354c77b9.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b1354c77b9.jpg\" alt=\"On the left is a cherry tree with ripe cherries. On the right are some chairs with people sitting on them as seen from behind. In the distance is a stage with three people and a screen that says ‚ÄúApple Design Awards‚Äù.\"></a></p>\n<p>Following the awards ceremony, was the final event of the day. It was billed as &ldquo;Special Evening Activity&rdquo; in the days leading up to WWDC, but it was announced earlier that it would be a visit to the Steve Jobs Theater for something related to the Vision Pro hardware. It was unclear if people would get a chance to try it out so there was suddenly a surge of people towards that direction because of course no one wanted to miss that opportunity if it presented itself. The crowd was met by a line of Apple employees that stopped the flow, while whatever final preparations were made so that we could be led there in small batches. Apparently inside the cafe were preparations for beverages and dinner, but I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone made it to that.</p>\n<p>Thankfully I was near the front of the crowd, so my wait was only about thirty minutes. I walked over to the theater, which was hidden from view until the very last bend in the path.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/a02094e55c.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/a02094e55c.jpg\" alt=\"A path leads to a circular building in the distance. There are people going to and coming from there. The building has floor to ceiling glass which is reflecting some light from the setting sun. The sky above is partly cloudy.\"></a></p>\n<p>Inside the building was a display of all the new mac hardware but also a line to go downstairs. I made my way down there and into a hands-off area where a number of Vision Pro were on display to see, but not to handle.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/99f5c56796.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/99f5c56796.jpg\" alt=\"An up-close photo of two Apple Vision Pro devices with people in the blurred background.\"></a></p>\n<p>A few minutes later as I emerged from the theater building, I saw this lovely sunset view of the grass and the main building.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/afdcce21ff.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/afdcce21ff.jpg\" alt=\"Golden grass in the foreground and Apple Park building in the distance, with a dramatic cloudy sky above.

I arrived there at about 6pm. There were hundreds of Apple retail employees at various stations for facilitating check-ins and to greet people as they arrived and left.

				"content_text": "[![A set of rainbow colored arches are visible in the background with some trees and flowers in the foreground.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/912dcff903.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/912dcff903.jpg)\n\nLast week I went to Cupertino for Apple's Special Event at Apple Park.\n\n### The Main Event\n\nThe announcements at the event and the hot takes around it have gone around the internet, and the world, perhaps a dozen times by now. This is not a post about that, but about my personal experience.\n\n[![View of conference area from back and above. A large screen with the Apple logo is visible in the distance. There a number of rows of chairs in between. Tall steel grey pillars dominate the vertical space.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/6981b709e9.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/6981b709e9.jpg)\n\nI arrived about an hour before the keynote. After going through the security check, I made my way to Caff√© Macs where the event was set up. There was food and beverages. I picked up some coffee, some overnight oats with blueberry compote, and a savory pastry. Once I was done with that I found spot amongst some Apple engineers just in time for the keynote to start.\n\nAfter the keynote was lunchtime. I walked round for a bit looking at all the food options before settling on the grilled chicken with salad. I took this over to the inner meadow where there were a number of tables set up.\n\n[![A number of tables are set up in rows in a meadow with people seated at them. Rainbow arches are visible in the distance. A cloudy hazy sky above.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b2c188c364.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b2c188c364.jpg)\n\nI sat down randomly and started to eat and chat with others. Turned out I was sitting right next to an industrial designer on the Vision Pro, so the conversation was mostly about that.\n\n[![Curved glass windows separate the outside from the inside. People walking around and seated on tables outside. Everything is reflected in glassy ceilings and awnings.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/10e7b90534.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/10e7b90534.jpg)\n\nThen it was time for the Platforms State of the Union. At first I went to the outside area by the main stage and sat on the fabric lounge chairs, but that was bothering my back so I came back inside to sit on a sturdier chair.\n\n[![A number of people in blue T-shirts with WWDC23 written on their backs are watching a screen with a video playing.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e8c0b943ee.jpg)\n\nAs I watched the video, I also noticed the space, how it was full of sunlight, large indoor trees, and expansive and seamlessly transitioning from inside to outside. And every bit of it was curved. This was certainly a unique space.\n\n[![Curved ceilings and windows let in sunlight high above the hall. The tops of steel pillars and indoor trees are also visible.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/154449a030.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/154449a030.jpg)\n\n[![A view from above of people on the floor level.

I had previously signed up for walking tours of the inner meadow and of the ring building, but that system seemed to have not worked too well for Apple as they were now just organizing all that on a first come first served basis. I got in line for the inner meadow tour.\n\n[![A young man is sitting at a table outdoors under a shade structure. He is using an Apple computer from thirty to forty years ago. He is surrounded by other similar tables which are all empty. In the background are a bunch of fruit trees.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/81b8070fa5.jpg)\n\nThe [tour lasted about thirty minutes](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/the-inner-meadow-tour-at-wwdc-2023_927319?scaleControl=false&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=false&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=null&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=undefined&captionBar=false&captionMenus=true). Our first stop was by some fruit trees where a docent talked about all the fruit they grow and how it is all set up.\n\n[![A curved concave building with large glass windows is visible in the distance. Fruit trees are in the foreground.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/f61c9b2d68.jpg)\n\nThe second stop was by a shallow pond. In the center of the pond was a round plate that goes up and down. This creates a gentle wave that is imperceptible unless one is looking closely, but makes a definite wave crashing sound as it reached the edge of the pond. that was pretty cool.\n\n[![A large round pond with a couple of ducks near the center. Behind it is a small hill with trees. The top of a curved building is behind that. Over it is a cloudy sky.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/9de7075f2e.jpg)\n\nThe third and final stop was by the rainbow arches where a different docent talked about how it came to be as originally a temporary sculpture that was later made permanent. Then we made our way back on the same path.\n\nRight after that I got in line for the building tour. This was very popular and there was a lot of management going on to get people into small batches and move them along as tour guides returned from their previous tour and started a new one. At this point it definitely felt like I was in line for a theme park ride.\n\nThe ring tour took us upstairs to the third level from one side of Caff√© Macs. Then to the inner side of the building, across the terrace overlooking the main event area and back down.\n\nAt one point a docent talked about the structure of the building. Some interesting facts:\n\n- Outer circumference is one mile. Inner circumference is 0.75 mile.\n- There's a four feet quake zone all around the outside, so the whole building is capable of moving significantly in case of an earthquake.\n- The two massive doors are the largest ever of their kind. And apparently super quiet when opening/closing.\n- A lot of the dirt from digging up the foundation is piled up and forms the landscaping.\n- The land is 80% greenery and 20% building. Previously it was the opposite.\n- The roof hosts the largest solar installation on a building.\n- The building temperature is maintained at a comfortable level by passive mechanisms most of the time.\n\n[![A view through the convex side of a curved glass window.

There we descended to a lower level where a gallery space had been set up showing photos and videos from behind the scenes of a project called [_Mirage_](https://mirage.place). There were even some samples of the cast glass made for the project.\n\n[![Glass awnings and windows are visible on three consecutive levels as viewed from the ground. Blue sky with wispy clouds above.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/680384854f.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/680384854f.jpg)\n\nNext up was the Apple Design Awards event. While it is definitely a crowning achievement for the winners, it is always fun and inspiring to see [all the apps that make it to the finals](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/), and this year was no exception. There was a lot of excitement and joy in the design awards.\n\n[![On the left is a cherry tree with ripe cherries. On the right are some chairs with people sitting on them as seen from behind. In the distance is a stage with three people and a screen that says ‚ÄúApple Design Awards‚Äù.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b1354c77b9.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b1354c77b9.jpg)\n\nFollowing the awards ceremony, was the final event of the day. It was billed as \"Special Evening Activity\" in the days leading up to WWDC, but it was announced earlier that it would be a visit to the Steve Jobs Theater for something related to the Vision Pro hardware. It was unclear if people would get a chance to try it out so there was suddenly a surge of people towards that direction because of course no one wanted to miss that opportunity if it presented itself. The crowd was met by a line of Apple employees that stopped the flow, while whatever final preparations were made so that we could be led there in small batches. Apparently inside the cafe were preparations for beverages and dinner, but I'm not sure if anyone made it to that.\n\nThankfully I was near the front of the crowd, so my wait was only about thirty minutes. I walked over to the theater, which was hidden from view until the very last bend in the path.\n\n[![A path leads to a circular building in the distance. There are people going to and coming from there. The building has floor to ceiling glass which is reflecting some light from the setting sun. The sky above is partly cloudy.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/a02094e55c.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/a02094e55c.jpg)\n\nInside the building was a display of all the new mac hardware but also a line to go downstairs. I made my way down there and into a hands-off area where a number of Vision Pro were on display to see, but not to handle.\n\n[![An up-close photo of two Apple Vision Pro devices with people in the blurred background.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/99f5c56796.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/99f5c56796.jpg)\n\nA few minutes later as I emerged from the theater building, I saw this lovely sunset view of the grass and the main building.\n\n[![Golden grass in the foreground and Apple Park building in the distance, with a dramatic cloudy sky above. Everything is lit by the late evening sunlight.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/afdcce21ff.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/afdcce21ff.jpg)\n\nFrom there I made my way out as that was it for the day.\n\n### The Evening Before the Main Event\n\n[![A selfie of me in front of the ‚Äú1 Infinite Loop‚Äù sign.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e15e7ccb74.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/e15e7ccb74.jpg)\n\nThe main event was on Monday, but an early check-in gathering was organized for the evening before at Apple's old headquarters at Infinite Loop. I arrived there at about 6pm. There were hundreds of Apple retail employees at various stations for facilitating check-ins and to greet people as they arrived and left. On check-in I received a badge and also a tote bag filled with goodies.\n\n[![Event swag on a table: tote bag, black cap, small black insulated tumblr, various enamel pins.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b75047e728.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/b75047e728.jpg)\n\nThe gathering was in a courtyard-like large open area surrounded by campus buildings. There were beverages, and seating. I got a beverage and mulled about the crowd. I met a couple of people I knew from online, and a few other people that I'd not met before. I was there for less than an hour and left shortly before the event ended, to make my way to Miniboss Arcade in downtown San Jose for the [RevenueCat party](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/company/bay-area-jun23/).\n\n### The Morning After the Main Event\n\n[![A dimly lit theater in blue and red light, with a screen showing the Apple logo. A number of seated people are viewed from behind.](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/4003a3622c.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2023/4003a3622c.jpg)\n\nOn Tuesday morning I went to an event at the Apple Developer Center, across the street from Apple Park.

I wonder if its rating will go up or down with time.</li>\n<li>I have seen seventeen of these films. The others are now on my to-watch list üòÑ</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notes on the data filtering and sorting process to get to the final list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only movies. This eliminated shorts, TV, etc.</li>\n<li>Not animated. Apparently it is common for animated movies to have more than one director, so they were sort of skewing the results away from what I really intended to discover, even though I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time I asked myself that leading question.</li>\n<li>High rating (&gt; 7.5) and high number of votes (&gt; 250000). I tweaked these to narrow down a short list. If I only maximized one or the other, the results didn&rsquo;t seem representative of the question.</li>\n<li>Year of release used as a tie breaker. I figured a more recent film with a high rating had a larger impact on the zeitgeist and so deserved to be higher on the list.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The script can be <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/samgrover/1e7841ac4041bdf921a6da8b9e5b67fa\">found here</a>.</p>\n<p>P.S.

Mackye Gruber  \n\nSome thoughts on these results:\n\n- Most of the films here are from the last twenty-five years. _Gone with the Wind_ and _The Wizard of Oz_ are the two remarkable exceptions, surprisingly from the same year, 1939, and with the same main director, Victor Fleming.\n- _Gone with the Wind_ has a runtime of 238 minutes, which is far above any other film here, and that makes it additionally remarkable that it is on this list.\n- _Everything Everywhere All at Once_ was a surprise to see here, given its newness. I wonder if its rating will go up or down with time.\n- I have seen seventeen of these films. The others are now on my to-watch list üòÑ\n\nNotes on the data filtering and sorting process to get to the final list:\n\n- Only movies. This eliminated shorts, TV, etc.\n- Not animated. Apparently it is common for animated movies to have more than one director, so they were sort of skewing the results away from what I really intended to discover, even though I didn't realize it at the time I asked myself that leading question.\n- High rating (> 7.5) and high number of votes (> 250000). I tweaked these to narrow down a short list. If I only maximized one or the other, the results didn't seem representative of the question.\n- Year of release used as a tie breaker. I figured a more recent film with a high rating had a larger impact on the zeitgeist and so deserved to be higher on the list.\n\nThe script can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/samgrover/1e7841ac4041bdf921a6da8b9e5b67fa).\n\nP.S. The dataset obviously has biases and those impact the results.\n",

The one on the left is the new one.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/30e59e554a.jpg)\n\nHaving resolved that we built up all the layers for the structure.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/8b6ce01f44.jpg)\n\nThe final step was loading all the dirt which went by a lot faster with bags than it did with shoveling a pile last year.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/74f60c7d77.jpg)\n\nSome slo-mo fun was had too!\n\n<video controls=\"controls\" playsinline=\"playsinline\" src=\"https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/com-samgrover-dropshare/dirtbag-slo-mo.mov\" poster=\"https://f001.backblazeb2.com/file/com-samgrover-dropshare/dirtbag-slo-mo-poster.jpg\" preload=\"none\" width=\"608\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"Dirtbag collapse in slo-mo\"></video>\n\nA couple of days later Jenni planted all the garlic.

Mostly out of technological curiosity, and sure, a little bit out of a need for convenience. We didn&rsquo;t even have a doorbell, so people visiting or leaving packages would simply knock on the door which was easy to miss.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the prominent products made by large tech companies constantly stream video data from a doorbell to their servers for analysis and trade. That wasn&rsquo;t something I wanted.  So I was on the lookout for a product that would keep the video data local to my home network. It would still send data over the internet to my device if I wanted to access it, or respond to a doorbell ring, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be sending significant amounts of data that is of no value to me but has value to the surveillance industry.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, I have a bit of knowledge on tech stuff, so I can setup and manage a home network. I have wired ethernet cables in my house, and have slowly upgraded my network to use more advanced networking equipment made by Ubiquiti, rather than the stock WiFi enabled router provided by my ISP. It was with this in mind that I learned the Ubiquiti had recently launched a video doorbell in their UniFi line, which is what I use for my home networking equipment. Once I got a chance to place an order, I did, and sure enough the doorbell arrived a few days later. That was the easy part.</p>\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, we didn&rsquo;t have a doorbell, so we didn&rsquo;t even have wiring for it. I did some research, and figured out how I wanted to wire it. It&rsquo;s a low voltage circuit that requires a step-down AC transformer. Normally that is attached to the wiring directly at a box in an inaccessible area, but I found a solution where I could access a wall outlet and so wouldn&rsquo;t need to drill into a wall or floor. A friend had a plug-in transformer that he wasn&rsquo;t using, so all I needed was some wire, which I ordered. I also ordered a mechanical chime that would ring when the doorbell was pressed. I drew this rough sketch of how I imagined it getting wired.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/434d226695.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>At this point I set up a circuit on my desk and wired everything up. First it was just the doorbell which was easy to start and setup. Then I wired in the chime and tested that everything worked fine, which it did üéâ</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/cf13bb3d05.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>I was able to use an existing wire path for part of the way from the outlet to the door, so I got going by pulling wire through that. I drilled a hole next to the door, ran the wire through and installed the doorbell. Once again I tested that it was working fine. Next I installed the chime on the wall above the door on the inside and connected it to the circuit. And that was it for the wiring. Everything worked well. The doorbell had a good signal. This is what it looked like.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/9fbf77ec30.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Now all I had to do was to clean up and conceal the wiring. I didn&rsquo;t have anything for this so I researched some more and ordered some cable concealing strips. Once those arrived I set about cutting pieces to length and enclosed much of the wire by the door with it. I also hid some of the wiring in the moulding along which I had run it. That was handy and probably cut my concealing cost in half.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\"><img src=\"https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/afea39f4f5.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>So far the experience has been nice. There&rsquo;s still issues with the integration of the app. The notification always fires when the doorbell rings, but live video and audio can be cut off some times. These are software issues and I hope they get resolved soon. A new app update came out while I was writing this post and that greatly improved the performance of showing video right after launching the app. It&rsquo;s good to know they are making improvements like I had hoped.</p>\n<p>In these pandemic days it&rsquo;s mostly just package delivery people coming by and I&rsquo;ve noticed that only about half of them ring the doorbell. There have been no times when I&rsquo;ve needed to talk to someone. I&rsquo;m still dialing in the right motion triggers and sensitivity so I can minimize the false positives.

				"content_text": "Yesterday was one of those amazing Fall days when the sky is clear and the air is crisp. After going through ten days dealing with wildfire smoke, and another few days of overcast skies and much-needed rain, it was a welcome change. So, we went out for a short hike in [the Forest Park area](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Tolinda-Ridge_Trail_Loop_Hike).\n\nThere are nice views from the trail. This is at a viewpoint very close to the start. St John's Bridge, with Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Rainier in the distance.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/fc407f03d8.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/fc407f03d8.jpg)\n\nJenni at a point on the trail.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/df032d7875.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/df032d7875.jpg)\n\nMt. Hood, as seen from St John's Bridge. We couldn't get parking at the trailhead so we parked at the other end of the bridge and walked over it. That was an additional bit of fun despite my not-so-great feelings of looking down from it üòÖ.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/639af7afc4.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/639af7afc4.jpg)\n\nAfter the hike we ended up at this recently opened food cart pod and had a meal there. This was the first time we've eaten out since the pandemic started. It was a bit unnerving for me to be in the midst of so many people without masks but overall it was enjoyable.\n\n[![](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/d74fec6bf6.jpg)](https://samgrover.com/uploads/2020/d74fec6bf6.jpg)\n\n### Activity Stats\n\nDistance: 4.5 miles  \nElevation Gain: 577 ft  \nTime (including breaks): 2h\n\nImages uploaded using [Mimi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimi-uploader/id1484555696).\n",

If that number feels large, know that far more would have shown up in person if this vile event had happened in better times, and at the place he had called home for twenty years. Over the last couple of weeks I've heard several stories of his friendships, generosities and kindnesses. He was beloved by many. \r\n\r\nOur family has set up [an online memorial site](https://ashish-grover.forevermissed.com). If you knew him, I encourage you to share something there if you like.\r\n\r\n![Us, with our sisters.

Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn&rsquo;t have a chance to use during the trial period. I&rsquo;ve now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.</p>\n<p>If you would like to try out Setapp, <a href=\"https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8\">select here to use my referral code</a>.</p>\n",

But there are several that are new to me.\n\nApps that I found myself using often during the trial:\n\n* Marked\n* Mindnode\n* Flume\n* Timing\n* iStat Menus\n\nApps I installed and use occasionally and would expect to use occasionally in the future:\n\n* WiFi Explorer\n* World Clock Pro\n\nApps I tried but then uninstalled after using just one or two times:\n\n* CleanMyMac X\n* IconJar\n* Luminar Flex\n\nApps that are included in Setapp but which I've previously bought individually and use anyway:\n\n* Screens\n* Paw\n* Sip\n\nSo with a very rough mental calculation I think the math would work out alright. Of course the main hook/promise of Setapp is the _potential_ of all the other apps. Many may not be relevant today but may become relevant tomorrow. Their [stated goal](https://support.setapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000890969-Setapp-applications):\n\n> We have 100+ apps in the stack and are steadily adding more of them to cover all of your main needs. Eventually, Setapp is to deliver about 300 Mac apps, all per a single $9.99 fee (+ taxes).\n\nI have already identified some apps that I plan to use soon but just didn't have a chance to use during the trial period. I've now subscribed for one month, and if it still seems useful after that, I will likely switch to the annual plan for 10% off.\n\nIf you would like to try out Setapp, [select here to use my referral code](https://go.setapp.com/invite/v6jr3hc8).\n",

The highlight was the visit to the Oregon Coast Aquarium. Also, after three-and-a-half years at Intel, I left to join Small Society to make cool iOS apps. I started at Small Society on 22nd March.</li>\n\t<li>June - While in LA, Liz had to undergo emergency surgery for the removal of her ruptured appendix. She returned home a week after that and has recuperated well. Got an iPhone 4 which has a decent enough camera that for the first time ever I'm comfortable with my phone being the only camera on my person when I travel.</li>\n\t<li>July - I had to fly down to LA and drive our car back from there since we flew Liz up to Portland after her surgery. Traded in the MINI for a Subaru Outback.  We had to <a href=\"http://blog.samgrover.com/2010/08/01/goodbye-yoshi/\">let Yoshi go</a>.</li>\n\t<li>August - My parents visited us in Portland and we had a great time showing them around Portland. We also visited Seattle, Crater Lake and Bend.</li>\n\t<li>September - Visited Disney World in Florida for ten days. It was a vacation for us and a chance for my parents to meet Liz's parents for the first time. We all had a great time there. I also visited family in Chicago for a few days.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIt was another amazing year and I‚Äôm looking forward to the next one.\n\nAnd lastly, here‚Äôs more about the number <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34_%28number%29\">34</a>.\n",

The book is about food production and agriculture in the US. It is also about man&rsquo;s relation to food and to the culture of eating. This is not a review of the book, but rather a summary of my thoughts on this subject as it relates to my personal health and habits.</p>\n<p>Many years ago I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Super Size Me<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Following that I stopped eating at McDonald&rsquo;s and reduced my consumption of fast food in general. It wasn&rsquo;t until I saw <!-- raw HTML omitted -->King Corn<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Future of Food<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the reality of industrial agriculture began to sink in. I was increasingly disgusted by what I was eating.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been altering my food habits towards ones that I believe will support the goal of a healthier life. Habits, that were encouraged by my parents while I was growing up, but those that I easily ignored in my adult independence. My mom taught me that just about anything is good in moderation but nothing is good in excess. Pollan&rsquo;s observations on food show just how much excess is involved in industrial food. Observations of my own diet revealed that I was having too much meat and processed food and not enough vegetables, whole grains and fruits. I also found a large amount of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->HFCS<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in my diet, mostly from soda, but also, and this was a surprise to me, from ketchup and other products.</p>\n<p>Throughout my twenties, I didn&rsquo;t think twice about what I was eating as long as it tasted good, and often, fast and convenient. My younger body could take that abuse without much consequence. My older body won&rsquo;t tolerate abuse as it gets confused and transformed by the bad food I eat. It is imperative that I live a healthy life and for that it is necessary that I eat healthy food. Enough is enough.</p>\n<p>Having moved to the US from India, I&rsquo;ve always admired the nutrition label on foods sold here. What I had often ignored was the list of ingredients. Now, more than ever, I find that information very valuable when eating or buying food. Labeling is important and I would like to see it become even more descriptive to capture the source of ingredients and to their status as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->GMOs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;m grateful to those that research information about food and agriculture and seek to have it readily accessible.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months I&rsquo;ve been eating much less meat. I have eliminated HFCS from my diet. I have greatly reduced the consumption of processed food and increased the consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. I acknowledge that as I seek to minimize my consumption of unhealthy food I may occasionally give in to the desires of speed, convenience or taste. Having Liz in my life has significantly helped to reintroduce and encourage healthier eating habits. Her food ethic is much stronger than mine and she is acutely conscious of what she consumes.</p>\n<p>As an omnivore I can eat many things, but I won&rsquo;t just eat any thing.</p>\n",

It wasn't until I saw <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012680D0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thapnasasbl-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B0012680D0\">King Corn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/watch/67878/the-future-of-food\">The Future of Food</a> that the reality of industrial agriculture began to sink in. I was increasingly disgusted by what I was eating.\n\nI've been altering my food habits towards ones that I believe will support the goal of a healthier life. Habits, that were encouraged by my parents while I was growing up, but those that I easily ignored in my adult independence. My mom taught me that just about anything is good in moderation but nothing is good in excess. Pollan's observations on food show just how much excess is involved in industrial food. Observations of my own diet revealed that I was having too much meat and processed food and not enough vegetables, whole grains and fruits. I also found a large amount of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fructose_corn_syrup\">HFCS</a> in my diet, mostly from soda, but also, and this was a surprise to me, from ketchup and other products.\n\nThroughout my twenties, I didn't think twice about what I was eating as long as it tasted good, and often, fast and convenient. My younger body could take that abuse without much consequence. My older body won't tolerate abuse as it gets confused and transformed by the bad food I eat. It is imperative that I live a healthy life and for that it is necessary that I eat healthy food. Enough is enough.\n\nHaving moved to the US from India, I've always admired the nutrition label on foods sold here. What I had often ignored was the list of ingredients. Now, more than ever, I find that information very valuable when eating or buying food. Labeling is important and I would like to see it become even more descriptive to capture the source of ingredients and to their status as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism\">GMOs</a>. I'm grateful to those that research information about food and agriculture and seek to have it readily accessible.\n\nOver the last few months I've been eating much less meat. I have eliminated HFCS from my diet. I have greatly reduced the consumption of processed food and increased the consumption of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables. I acknowledge that as I seek to minimize my consumption of unhealthy food I may occasionally give in to the desires of speed, convenience or taste. Having Liz in my life has significantly helped to reintroduce and encourage healthier eating habits. Her food ethic is much stronger than mine and she is acutely conscious of what she consumes.\n\nAs an omnivore I can eat many things, but I won't just eat any thing.\n",

She said yes. Bought a Wii. The engagement was decidedly more memorable, but the Wii has been fun too :-)</li>\n\t<li>April - Attended a concert by Zakir Hussain and met him.</li>\n\t<li>May - Went to the hot springs at Brietenbush. Sis and niece came over to visit. We all had a great time.</li>\n\t<li>June - Moved to a new place right next to the river in NW Portland. Liz spoke at Ignite Portland 3.</li>\n\t<li>July - Liz and I made a¬†<a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/our-trip-to-maine/\">trip to Maine</a> to visit her parents and to spend the 4th of July holiday with them.

It was my first time in Europe.</li>\n\t<li>August - Liz and I had our <a href=\"http://samandliz.wordpress.com/2008/10/05/we-got-married/\">Portland wedding</a>. Our New Delhi wedding is in December. We went to Crater Lake for a weekend. Beautiful place. Our first time there.

Perhaps a 35mm lens, but more on that later. I bought this Bessa at <!-- raw HTML omitted -->CameraQuest<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, a website that I haven&rsquo;t visited since then. I never planned on buying more of this system and I never had any issues.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->early experience with a rangefinder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> camera was in 2006 when I borrowed a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Canonet QL17 G-III<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from my friend <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Doug<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. At the end of that month I was hooked and understood why the rangefinder is the best camera for street photography. A sentiment expressed by many a famous street photographers of the last century. My favorite part about a rangefinder is that since I can see the frame lines, I can see the things that I&rsquo;m not including in the frame. You can never do that with an SLR. That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>Over the last year I&rsquo;ve put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my Flickr photostream<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That&rsquo;s not an immense number and probably would&rsquo;ve been even smaller had I not made the trips to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Burning Man<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->India<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.</p>\n<p>I like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven&rsquo;t experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes.</p>\n<p>I think I&rsquo;ve spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that&rsquo;s what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I&rsquo;ll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)</p>\n",

That allows me to frame the shot best, especially on the street when I have only a fraction of a second to frame and shoot a photo. I don't have to worry about focusing because I pre-focus and set a high depth-of-field. When I bring the camera to my eye, all I have to do is frame and click. And I love it when the camera goes \"click\". The Bessa has a quick sharp sound that is barely noticeable as compared to the extended louder sound of the DSLR.<br /><br />Another characteristic of the rangefinder is that you can see the photo at the moment of exposure, while in the SLR you just see nothing. As a result, at the beginning, my timing was  a bit off with this camera, but not only did I get used to it, I started to love it. Most of the time I take a photo, I just click one frame. No second chance. So it helps to know if I got what I was going for, even though the suspense remains until I actually get the film processed.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/1429955514/\" title=\"Swinging by samgrover, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1015/1429955514_2555d1be68_m.jpg\" alt=\"Swinging\" height=\"240\" width=\"154\" /></a>\n\nOver the last year I've put up 193 photos taken with this camera on <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/\">my Flickr photostream</a>, about 76% of all my uploaded photos for 2007. That's not an immense number and probably would've been even smaller had I not made the trips to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157602125513976/show/\">Burning Man</a> and to <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/sets/72157603288998293/show/\">India</a>. I put up 481 photos in 2006 and 807 photos in 2005. I think the trend is down because the cost of using film has made me frugal.\n\nI like using film because of the texture that it imparts to a photograph. I haven't experimented a whole lot with different films, and settled quite early with Tri-X. Most of the time I push it to ISO 1600 and gives me just the right kind of contrast I like. It also helps to push the film in Portland, since most days are overcast and higher ISO films cost more ;-) Having said that, more and more manufacturers of are moving out of the 35mm film market. That trend has me thinking of digital rangefinders for the future. We'll see how that goes.\n\nI think I've spent enough time with the 50mm lens to now explore more primes. I would prefer to go wider, as that's what I find lacking sometimes when I frame a shot. Also, I think it would help me get closer while out on the street. So, sometime this year, I'll get a 35mm M mount lens, hopefully a Leica one. After all, that was the plan :-)\n",

For more info and details from the blogosphere, see <a href=\"http://www.ultrabrown.com/posts/terrorists-blow-up-bombay-trains\" title=\"Terrorists blow up Bombay trains\">Ultrabrown</a>,  <a href=\"http://gauravsabnis.blogspot.com/2006/07/blasts-in-bombay.html\" title=\"Blasts in Bombay\">Vantage Point</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/003563.html\" title=\"Bombay's rush hour rocked by blasts\">Sepia Mutiny</a>, <a href=\"http://mumbaihelp.blogspot.com/\" title=\"Mumbai Help\">MumbaiHelp</a>, and <a href=\"http://mumbai.metblogs.com/\" title=\"Metroblogging Mumbai\">Metroblogging Mumbai</a>. Unfortunately, this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Mumbai_bombings\" title=\"1993 Mumbai bombings\">isn't the first time</a> this beloved city has been a target.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Just the other day, in conversation with friends, I was reminiscing my experiences with riding the trains in Bombay. I grew up there through most of the nineties, mid-teens to early twenties. Rush hour travel is the kind of thing you'd remember fondly only if you were nostalgic. The train cars are sometimes packed so tight, one could travel upright without either foot on the floor. 4.5 million people commute on the trains everyday. With that in mind, the horror of these events is inescapable. Emotions will run high, we'll all mourn, but the people of Mumbai will not be terrorized.</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In 1993, in the days after the thirteen serial bomb blasts in two hours, there were billboards proclaiming that the city got back on it's feet within 24 hours. In memory of those who died, I hope that spirit prevails, that the aftermath is peaceful, and that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</p>\n",

Here are some of my impressions with using this camera.\n<ul>\n<li>It&#039;s a little bizzare to see the lens through the viewfinder, but I got over that pretty soon.</li>\n<li>It is well known that rangefinders are quiet because they don&#039;t have a moving mirror. Even so, I was surprised by the quietness of the mechanism.</li>\n<li>The shutter priority operation threw me off for a while because I&#039;m used to shooting with aperture priority. It makes me think in terms of time, while I&#039;m used to thinking in terms of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field\" title=\"Depth of field\">depth of field</a>, or rather not thinking much in terms of either by setting the parameters once and not messing with it unless really needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgrover/151705515/\" title=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"http://static.flickr.com/50/151705515_58bd3e843d_m.jpg\" alt=\"In the tree&#039;s shadow\" align=\"left\" height=\"160\" width=\"240\" /></a>The hardest thing to do was the focusing. The viewfinder has a very small area to check the focus accurately, and its not something I could manage to do quickly. I found myself pre-focusing most of the time by reading the distance marking on the lens. So, I used the viewfinder only for framing, just before taking the picture. I like the speed of such operation, but have been reluctant to do pre-focusing before now. This camera kinda forced it upon me and I&#039;ll try to do it more often. I think it is a good skill to have for street photography, especially when using a manual focus mechanism. There is usually no time to focus.\n\nIt&#039;s been <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/samgrover/77921985/\" title=\"Of course it&#039;s raining, d&#039;uh!\">raining again</a> for the last week, so I haven&#039;t had any chance to shoot more with this camera.

It is based on Anthony Burgess' book of the same name. It is one of my favorite movies and I had never seen it in a theater. So, off I went for a dose of the ultraviolence.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The theater manager informed us that it was the largest turnout in their current series of classic films. The print was an original one, scratches and all. There was even a bit of trouble with it towards the end, which caused a pause in the show. That brought on comments, the likes of which are only heard when the audience comprises fans of a cult classic.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">There are many cool things about this movie. The dialogues are peppered with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat\">Nadsat</a>, which Burgess invented. Some things made sense only on repeat viewing. That is probably one of the hallmarks of a cult movie, I guess. The movie is beautiful to look at, with lovely locations and colorful costumes. The performances are superb. But the best part, in my opinion, is the music. Beethoven's 9th Symphony forms a part of the story and is partially heard in Wendy Carlos' electronic rendition.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">See it. Again.</p>\n",

Google is a major focus of the book, and its influence and growth surely warrant that focus.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">What motivated me to read this book was the concept of the \"<a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/000063.php\">Database of Intentions</a>\". It refers to the ability of an ubiquitous search technology to extract the intention of one or more of its users by analyzing their interactions with a plethora of devices. That is absolutely fascinating and will be quite something when it is realized. Needless to say, it will be the Oracle of the information age. It is an update on the idea of the Memex described by Vannevar Bush in \"<a title=\"As We May Think\" href=\"http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml\">As We May Think</a>\", which is cited in the book. A meta-Memex.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">A good portion of the book, however, is devoted to the history of search technology and industry. That is quite interesting in and of itself as I like to read about such things. There are several anecdotes about the people and companies that played a part in these nascent times. I found it to be too detailed in some places, but the book is written such that one could easily skip those parts if one finds them too dull. I didn't.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">The epilogue highlights that we remember people from history because they became immortal through records. In the future, everyone will be immortal because everything will be recorded. This blog is being recorded. All of it will add to the noise and one will have to shout or be referenced a lot to be seen clearly. Will you shout? What will you say? I think you should write a book while they are still in vogue ;-)</p>\n",

The book is about the author's efforts to understand the human brain's mechanism for intelligence and to apply it to machines. He presents a model of intelligence called the memory-prediction framework.</p>\n<p align=\"left\">This was perhaps the first time I had read a somewhat detailed analysis of the possible mechanism that drives human intelligence. Some concepts that I found especially interesting were that of invariant and hierarchical memory. Also, the idea that the brain predicts all actions before they are executed was fascinating.
